We started out with a team of three with an aim to provide everything that is necessary to the students during the four years of college and now, after two successful years, we have a large team of hardworking and committed students working in various departments.\r\n\r\nThe aim of CollegeSpace is to provide all the details about the various activities happening in NSIT under its NSIT Portal Section which includes everything about societies and updates related to college and under its Academics Section where all the content related to academics i.e. notes, files, exam papers etc. has been provided.\r\n\r\nIn its first year, it had a daily average of 116 visitors and 566 page views and total 2.7 lakh views and 330 GB data transfer. On 31st July 2012, we launched CollegeSpace Version 2.0, a new website with a few new sections and within 2 months we completed 1200 registered members. The reason for success of CollegeSpace and it being the most frequently-visited site by NSITians is that it has the ability to cater to the needs of every NSITian.",

On the other hand most of the Software Companies aren't able to fill their job vacancies because they don't get good candidates.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the fact that the content and methodology of teaching hasn't kept the pace with the fast changing IT sector. Another problem is that no IT professionals want to mentor/teach these students because teaching is far less lucrative financially compared to working for IT firms.\r\n\r\nAt Coding Blocks we want to bridge this gap by enabling students with the right skills which will help them by not just securing the best jobs but also enabling them to be productive from day 1 of their corporate lives.",

In May 1967, the school shifted to its present Aravali Campus at Subroto Park, Delhi Cantt. The school celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 1980.\n\nThe School is situated on the Aravali ridge - amidst picturesque surroundings - lined by rows of majestic Eucalyptus and Ashoka trees. In the 15 acre area of the school, there are numerous varieties of Bougainvillea, ranging from the common Pink to the rare lovely Mary Palmer which blossoms throughout the year. Although the school was established primarily for the benefit of children belonging to the IAF personnel, it has always been open to wards of Army and Navy personnel as well as to Civilians. Thereby it satisfies a long felt need of the Air Force personnel and simultaneously provides quality education to a much wider spectrum of children, from all over the country.\n\nThe Air Force School is a co-educational public school with boarding facilities for boys of classes VI to XII. The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and is a member of the National Progressive Schools Conference (NPSC). The school has been declared ISO certified in the year 2007.",

As students, sitting on desks was major part of their days and a good fitness-focussed diet had never been a practical possibility at the universities. With our varied backgrounds and experiences in fitness, bioscience and technology, we came up with a range of products to help you be in better shape every day.\n\nTHE INSPIRATION\nAt The Healthy Company (a brand under Alnourish pvt ltd), we are focused on leveraging bio-technology and nutritional science to empower you to achieve your health goals. We make really tasty health-bars that help you get lean, detox your body and refuel your energy based on your health goals. Most importantly, the central foundation of our philosophy is anything we make must be scientifically-proven and backed by biological research because like most people, we too wasted a lot of time and money in following the newest health fads and trends which were nothing but over-hyped.\n\nHence the three of us combined our experiences in fitness and bioscience into what culminated in the range of Health Bars by The Healthy Company.",

Our generation faces many distractions and struggles to find relevant information in the least possible time. Add to that, the way news is being delivered is not the way human mind works. The human mind is a story processor and not a logic processor and since the traditional media houses don’t provide the users with the background, it doesn’t appeal to them. The solution to this problem is NewsBytes. We answer the first 5 questions that come to the users'​ mind on reading a news headline.\n\nApp link: https://goo.gl/BeP2x2\nWeb link: www.newsbytesapp.com\nBot link: https://m.me/NewsBytesApp",

On 31st July 2012, we launched CollegeSpace Version 2.0, a new website with a few new sections and within 2 months we completed 1200 registered members. The reason for success of CollegeSpace and it being the most frequently-visited site by NSITians is that it has the ability to cater to the needs of every NSITian.",

        "description": "We are passionate about technology and sustainable planet. We strongly believe in power of technology and data and want to leverage these to make a meaningful contribution towards a sustainable planet. \n\nData has shown that increase in electricity generation over the years has not been able to keep pace with increasing demand which makes energy efficiency a critical need of the hour. Primary focus has lately been on retrofits and operational efficiency has been overlooked. The inspiration for starting this company further came from the extensive research done by our co-founder and CTO, Dr. Amarjeet Singh, which has shown commercial buildings waste more than 30% of electricity that they use.\n\nWe started Zenatix, a data-driven energy efficiency company with the sole purpose of making a significant dent in our fight against carbon footprint. We use advanced machine learning based models and deliver 10 to 30% energy efficiency to large commercial consumers of electricity. The models are built by collecting and analyzing more than 30 million of previously unseen (“dark”) data points every day from electrical assets. These models allow for automated and intelligent controls along with predictive and preventive maintenance of these assets, resulting in consistent and comfortable consumer experience in retail and banking sites while delivering high energy savings. We aim to address the energy efficiency problem across a range of customers and eventually help grids turn smarter. \n\nOur first solution (“WattMan”) addresses the problem for large retail chains and banking/financial set ups. WattMan is built over a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) stack and includes robust connected hardware developed in-house by Zenatix through extensive research and development.\n\nGiven the distributed nature of retail/banking set-ups (100s of thousands of outlets/branches, spread across the country), having a control over the electricity spend and providing the right customer experience at the same time is a big challenge. For example, in a Quick Service Restaurant (QSR), maintaining the right temperature in customer areas, kitchen areas and cold storages is crucial. Also, they need to make sure that all their air-conditioning, kitchen and refrigeration appliances are working optimally all the time. \n\nWattMan addresses these challenges in an automated manner through its cloud based intelligent controls driven by advanced machine learning algorithms. While it ensures the right quality of service with consistent temperature maintenance, the savings resulting from it, pays for the solution by itself.  This value proposition in retail/banking segment alone will allow Zenatix to capture significant portion of more than $2.5 billion market opportunity (in ARR terms), in India and South East Asia. WattMan was launched in April 2016 and since then around 20 customers (large retail chains/banks) have signed up. The company aims to continue adding more customers with additional focus on scaling up with the existing customers.\n\nZenatix is funded by leading VC funds in india - Blume Ventures and Pi Ventures. In addition, Zenatix has raised money from a group of prolific angel investors led by Rahul Khanna (Trifecta Capital), Rajan Anandan (Google) and Snapdeal co-founders, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal.",

Yet, we still have an education system whose teaching methodologies and curriculum remain largely unchanged for decades and does not address the problem of employability. To get access to quality formal education also means clearing various entrance exams and the entire semi-urban and rural population of the country does not have access to good quality coaching offline for the entrance exams. There is a dire need for an affordable solution that addresses these problems. \r\n\r\nAt ChalkStreet, we address these problems by creating a content marketplace focused on the career development of college students and young working professionals. ChalkStreet sources the best instructors for courses and productizes the content by converting them into a self-paced course thereby making it affordable. We are bringing in a new breed of people with relevant expertise, who also understand the industry requirements better, into the profession of teaching. We achieve this by making it suitably attractive for them in terms of reaching a wide audience as well as monetary rewards. ChalkStreet also has an interactive platform where these courses are converted into engaging learning experiences for our learners, effectively replacing the more expensive and often inaccessible offline choices.",

This is what we are aiming to change through Bridges of Sports. \nWe work with these children to provide them with the opportunity to train, excel and have a career in sports, irrespective of gender, disability, and background.\n\nPATANG - one of India’s first time based, community athletics league  is the fulcrum around which we have designed our sports model. It focuses specifically on nurturing grassroots and empowering isolated communities by utilizing sports as a social development tool. Through this initiative, we also recognized 14 naturally gifted athletes who are now training to represent themselves at national and international levels.\n\nWe have crafted a rigorous system through which we identify and equip community coaches to train children at local community schools. \nThrough gamification of the entire training strategy, we have not only increased motivational levels for both the coaches and the students but are also providing training to children at just 99 INR/month.",

Our goal is to develop a culture of authentic, independent and fact-based research and analysis.\n\nOur Research Culture:\nToday the Indian Financial Research industry is in dire need of original researchers. What is being provided today in the name of the research is superficial data jumbling or even quite often time pre-decided propaganda.\n\nWhile working in this industry for the last few years, we have come to realize that there is a huge scarcity of good researchers and that is due to false researching values and faulty research methodologies.\n\nTherefore to change this status quo, we at TMR have adopted our very own research culture where there is an emphasis on originality!\n\nYes!!! In TMR we believe in creating our own genuine research,  our analysts deep dive into the factual aspecs to bring out the real picture and in the process, they become experts in their domain.\n\nThe big question that came next was, where could we find out researchers with these qualities?  Where would we get researchers who carry out research in the right way?\n\nWhile thinking about this problem we came to realize that we would need to train our own researchers! That too, in their budding years! That’s the precise reason we started a set of Live Projects.\n\nDuring the course of the Live Projects, young minds with their creative approach will create new knowledge under the guidance of our industry experts!",
