        "description": "Initiated in 1993, PRAVAH is an NGO that works to build leadership for social change with young people. Over the last 20 years, we have developed a deep understanding & a unique perspective on youth development embodied by the concept of the 5th space. \r\n\r\n Traditionally, there are 4 socially legitimized spaces in a young person’s life: family, friends, livelihoods & leisure. The 5th space builds leadership skills of young people; skills that will help them to learn more about themselves, to build meaningful relationships,& to impact the world around them. The 5th space invests as much on personal transformation as it does on social transformation. While impacting society, young people also get impacted and it is these moments in a young person’s life that, if facilitated properly, hold the potential to become truly transformative experiences. Moreover, the 5th space makes the other 4 count too! A young person who belongs to a 5th space would not only be an active citizen, but also a caring family member, a sensitive friend, a diligent student, a good team player, an ethical consumer – in short – a good human being.\r\n\r\nPravah's interventions facilitate youth to lead social change while investing in their own development. We do this though designing and implementing a range of programmes with different segments of adolescents,  youth, social entrepreneurs and other stakeholders like established organisations and teachers in the country.\r\n\r\nfb: pravahdelhi w:pravahdelhi.wordpress.com",

        "description": "The establishment of Mohammedan Anglo Oriental (MAO) College in 1875 marks one of the most important events in the educational and social history of modern India. Its establishment is considered as the first significant response of the Indian Muslims to the challenges of post -1857 era. It was an important catalyst in a process of social change among Muslims.\r\nIn 1920, an Act of Indian Legislative Council elevated the M.A.O. College to the status of a Central University.

In business volume, the Bank occupies a premier position among the nationalised banks. \r\n\r\nThe Bank has 3101 branches in India spread over all states/ union territories including 141 specialised branches. These branches are controlled through 48 Zonal Offices . There are 29 branches/ offices (including three representative offices) abroad.Total number of shareholders as on 30/09/2009 is 2,15,790. \r\n\r\nWhile firmly adhering to a policy of prudence and caution, the Bank has been in the forefront of introducing various innovative services and systems.

ALLEN is named in the memory of Late Shri Laxmi Narayan Maheshwari.\r\n\r\nThis was the only institute of its time, providing coaching of all the subjects under one roof i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biology & Maths were taught altogether. This made tuition a very convenient approach for students in terms of time & conveyance.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 Shri Rajesh Maheshwari started tuition with just eight students & were well taught with honest devotion. Within few years this small tuition center has become the choice of student community, with this growing number of students the tuition center was converted into a full-fledged institute, providing coaching of all the subjects in 1989. At this juncture of time, the eminent professor of Biology Dr. K. G. Vaishanava joined the institute & this became a foundation stone of Pre-Medical preparation, as in 1991 institute achieved remarkable Landmark of 12 selections in RPMT.\r\n\r\nWhile ALLEN was on its way creating the history in Pre-Engineering & Pre-Medical Preparation year by year, Er. Brajesh Maheshwari joined the team with great enthusiasm & excellent engineering background. His knowledge of subject equipped the students with in-depth concepts of physics.\r\n\r\nThe consistent and ideal team efforts of faculty members, the vivid educational philosophy of all the HOD’s and the visionary administration of Shri Rajesh Maheshwari altogether laid the path of glorious success, when institute achieved First Rank in Rajasthan Pre-Medical Entrance in 1995.",

TRAQR is a ‘state-of-the-art’ –\r\n• Vehicle tracking... system using GPS satellites,\r\n• Vehicle usage knowledge and misuse protection,\r\n• Vehicle monitoring and security system.\r\n\r\nTRAQR empowers vehicle owners with extensive real-time location and usage information about their vehicles, and provides owners with control like never before. \r\n\r\nThe TRAQR Application uses –\r\n• GPS (Global Positioning System)\r\n• GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)\r\n• GSM (Global System for Mobile) and\r\n• GIS (Geographic Information System)\r\n\r\ntechnologies to determine real-time information – location, time, speed and route of the vehicle.

            "description": "Welcome to Zoonga! We’ve helped make the most magical, thrilling, & wonderful things happen since 2007.\n\nOnce India’s first entertainment & sports ticketing company, we’ve retained our reputation as the largest & fastest growing internationally, & we look forward to things staying that way. Our toys rival that of Tony Stark’s & so does our global outreach, & with those facilities, we take the “ick” out of “ticketing”. It doesn’t matter if it’s an online, retail, social, or box-office distribution channel, Zoonga has got you covered.\n\nIn a nutshell, what we do is take ticketing to the next level. We’re like the Flash, but faster, & like Mister Fantastic, but more flexible. We are the only ticketers in the subcontinent to have ticketed a major international event, the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, all forms of international cricket, several domestic cricket leagues & matches, & multiple Olympic-style sporting events & venues. Also, we're the only ticketers from the Indian subcontinent to have qualified for the prestigious position of being the official ticketing partner of the 2016 Olympics in Rio, & we got silver at the bid!\n\nBecause of our efforts in democratising access for consumers to world-class events while significantly enhancing their purchase experience, the ticketing marketplace has expanded greatly to bring tickets to consumers who have previously not been able to access major events.\n\nNot to mention, we’ve got some great partners who know how to have a good time. Our buds consist of some of the world’s leading sports franchises, concert promoters, event organisers, & not to mention, we’re backed by a $18 billion hedge fund based in New York that has multiple investments in cutting edge e-media companies (we’re one of them!). Plus, the global business magnate Mr Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of the Tata Group, is also an investor in the company.\n\nBut at the end of the day, our purpose has never wavered: tickets for everyone, everywhere.",

            "description": "Biocon: Enhancing Global Healthcare\n\nBiocon Limited, publicly listed in 2004, is India's largest and fully-integrated, innovation-led biopharmaceutical company. It is an emerging global biopharmaceutical enterprise serving customers in over 120 countries. Driven by a vision to enhance global healthcare through innovative and affordable biopharmaceuticals, we have enabled access to advanced therapies for diseases that are chronic, where medical needs are largely unmet and treatment costs are high. \n\nThe early anticipation of the increasing dominance of biologics in global development pipelines helped us to be ahead of the curve in crafting a differentiated product portfolio based on fermentation and recombinant technologies, which straddles fermentation-derived small molecules and biologics, both novel as well as biosimilars.\n\nThe significant brand equity that we have built worldwide for our small molecule APIs across statins, immunosuppresants and other specialty products has made us a leading global supplier of these products.\n\nWe have also built one of the largest and most diverse biosimilar pipelines, spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that address critical chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disorders.\n\nRanked among the Top 3 biosimilar players globally for rh-insulin and insulin glargine in volume terms, we are the first Indian company to launch a biosimilar in Japan with Insulin Glargine, which also has been approved for sale in EU and Australia. Our insulin products have made a difference to the lives of millions of people with diabetes across the globe. We now aim to provide our insulin products to ‘one in five’ people with diabetes in need of insulin-based therapy anywhere in the world within the next 10 years.\n\nWe are also making a huge impact in the area of cancer care. Our biosimilar Trastuzumab, which was the first to be approved anywhere in the world and launched in India in 2014, has helped treat several thousand HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. We are also the first company from India to get its biosimilar approved by the USFDA; Ogivri™, co-developed by Biocon and Mylan, is the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved in the US. In addition to Trastuzumab, several of our biosimilar assets are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets.\n\nWe are also developing a pipeline of patented biologics to address global unmet medical needs. We have successfully launched a couple of novel biologics in India: Nimotuzumab for the treatment of head and neck cancer and Itolizumab to tackle psoriasis. Besides these, we have a basket of novel assets are under various stages of clinical development, including a high potential oral insulin.\n\nThrough our subsidiary, Syngene, we offer a suite of integrated, end-to-end discovery and development services for novel molecular entities (NMEs) to the global life sciences sector.\n\nRanked by the prestigious Science magazine among the Top 10 Best employers in the biotech industry, Biocon is passionately pursuing a mission to rationalize healthcare spends, enhance access to life-saving therapies and make a significant impact to global healthcare through ‘blockbuster’ drugs with the potential to benefit a billion patients.",
