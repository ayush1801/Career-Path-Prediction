        "description": "Initiated in 1993, PRAVAH is an NGO that works to build leadership for social change with young people. Over the last 20 years, we have developed a deep understanding & a unique perspective on youth development embodied by the concept of the 5th space. \r\n\r\n Traditionally, there are 4 socially legitimized spaces in a young person’s life: family, friends, livelihoods & leisure. The 5th space builds leadership skills of young people; skills that will help them to learn more about themselves, to build meaningful relationships,& to impact the world around them. The 5th space invests as much on personal transformation as it does on social transformation. While impacting society, young people also get impacted and it is these moments in a young person’s life that, if facilitated properly, hold the potential to become truly transformative experiences. Moreover, the 5th space makes the other 4 count too! A young person who belongs to a 5th space would not only be an active citizen, but also a caring family member, a sensitive friend, a diligent student, a good team player, an ethical consumer – in short – a good human being.\r\n\r\nPravah's interventions facilitate youth to lead social change while investing in their own development. We do this though designing and implementing a range of programmes with different segments of adolescents,  youth, social entrepreneurs and other stakeholders like established organisations and teachers in the country.\r\n\r\nfb: pravahdelhi w:pravahdelhi.wordpress.com",

        "description": "The establishment of Mohammedan Anglo Oriental (MAO) College in 1875 marks one of the most important events in the educational and social history of modern India. Its establishment is considered as the first significant response of the Indian Muslims to the challenges of post -1857 era. It was an important catalyst in a process of social change among Muslims.\r\nIn 1920, an Act of Indian Legislative Council elevated the M.A.O. College to the status of a Central University.

        "description": "Bank of India was founded on 7th September, 1906 by a group of eminent businessmen from Mumbai. The Bank was under private ownership and control till July 1969 when it was nationalised along with 13 other banks. \r\n\r\nBeginning with one office in Mumbai, with a paid-up capital of Rs.50 lakh and 50 employees, the Bank has made rapid growth over years and blossomed into a mighty institution with a strong national presence and sizable international operations. In business volume, the Bank occupies a premier position among the nationalised banks. \r\n\r\nThe Bank has 3101 branches in India spread over all states/ union territories including 141 specialised branches. These branches are controlled through 48 Zonal Offices . There are 29 branches/ offices (including three representative offices) abroad.Total number of shareholders as on 30/09/2009 is 2,15,790. \r\n\r\nWhile firmly adhering to a policy of prudence and caution, the Bank has been in the forefront of introducing various innovative services and systems. Business has been conducted with the successful blend of traditional values and ethics and the most modern infrastructure. The Bank has been the first among the nationalised banks to establish a fully computerised branch and ATM facility at the Mahalaxmi Branch at Mumbai way back in 1989.

This made tuition a very convenient approach for students in terms of time & conveyance.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 Shri Rajesh Maheshwari started tuition with just eight students & were well taught with honest devotion. Within few years this small tuition center has become the choice of student community, with this growing number of students the tuition center was converted into a full-fledged institute, providing coaching of all the subjects in 1989. At this juncture of time, the eminent professor of Biology Dr. K. G. Vaishanava joined the institute & this became a foundation stone of Pre-Medical preparation, as in 1991 institute achieved remarkable Landmark of 12 selections in RPMT.\r\n\r\nWhile ALLEN was on its way creating the history in Pre-Engineering & Pre-Medical Preparation year by year, Er. Brajesh Maheshwari joined the team with great enthusiasm & excellent engineering background. His knowledge of subject equipped the students with in-depth concepts of physics.\r\n\r\nThe consistent and ideal team efforts of faculty members, the vivid educational philosophy of all the HOD’s and the visionary administration of Shri Rajesh Maheshwari altogether laid the path of glorious success, when institute achieved First Rank in Rajasthan Pre-Medical Entrance in 1995.",

We’ve helped make the most magical, thrilling, & wonderful things happen since 2007.\n\nOnce India’s first entertainment & sports ticketing company, we’ve retained our reputation as the largest & fastest growing internationally, & we look forward to things staying that way. Our toys rival that of Tony Stark’s & so does our global outreach, & with those facilities, we take the “ick” out of “ticketing”. It doesn’t matter if it’s an online, retail, social, or box-office distribution channel, Zoonga has got you covered.\n\nIn a nutshell, what we do is take ticketing to the next level. We’re like the Flash, but faster, & like Mister Fantastic, but more flexible. We are the only ticketers in the subcontinent to have ticketed a major international event, the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, all forms of international cricket, several domestic cricket leagues & matches, & multiple Olympic-style sporting events & venues. Also, we're the only ticketers from the Indian subcontinent to have qualified for the prestigious position of being the official ticketing partner of the 2016 Olympics in Rio, & we got silver at the bid!\n\nBecause of our efforts in democratising access for consumers to world-class events while significantly enhancing their purchase experience, the ticketing marketplace has expanded greatly to bring tickets to consumers who have previously not been able to access major events.\n\nNot to mention, we’ve got some great partners who know how to have a good time. Our buds consist of some of the world’s leading sports franchises, concert promoters, event organisers, & not to mention, we’re backed by a $18 billion hedge fund based in New York that has multiple investments in cutting edge e-media companies (we’re one of them!). Plus, the global business magnate Mr Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of the Tata Group, is also an investor in the company.\n\nBut at the end of the day, our purpose has never wavered: tickets for everyone, everywhere.",

        "description": "Biocon: Enhancing Global Healthcare\n\nBiocon Limited, publicly listed in 2004, is India's largest and fully-integrated, innovation-led biopharmaceutical company. It is an emerging global biopharmaceutical enterprise serving customers in over 120 countries. Driven by a vision to enhance global healthcare through innovative and affordable biopharmaceuticals, we have enabled access to advanced therapies for diseases that are chronic, where medical needs are largely unmet and treatment costs are high. \n\nThe early anticipation of the increasing dominance of biologics in global development pipelines helped us to be ahead of the curve in crafting a differentiated product portfolio based on fermentation and recombinant technologies, which straddles fermentation-derived small molecules and biologics, both novel as well as biosimilars.\n\nThe significant brand equity that we have built worldwide for our small molecule APIs across statins, immunosuppresants and other specialty products has made us a leading global supplier of these products.\n\nWe have also built one of the largest and most diverse biosimilar pipelines, spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that address critical chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disorders.\n\nRanked among the Top 3 biosimilar players globally for rh-insulin and insulin glargine in volume terms, we are the first Indian company to launch a biosimilar in Japan with Insulin Glargine, which also has been approved for sale in EU and Australia. Our insulin products have made a difference to the lives of millions of people with diabetes across the globe. We now aim to provide our insulin products to ‘one in five’ people with diabetes in need of insulin-based therapy anywhere in the world within the next 10 years.\n\nWe are also making a huge impact in the area of cancer care. Our biosimilar Trastuzumab, which was the first to be approved anywhere in the world and launched in India in 2014, has helped treat several thousand HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. We are also the first company from India to get its biosimilar approved by the USFDA; Ogivri™, co-developed by Biocon and Mylan, is the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved in the US. In addition to Trastuzumab, several of our biosimilar assets are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets.\n\nWe are also developing a pipeline of patented biologics to address global unmet medical needs. We have successfully launched a couple of novel biologics in India: Nimotuzumab for the treatment of head and neck cancer and Itolizumab to tackle psoriasis. Besides these, we have a basket of novel assets are under various stages of clinical development, including a high potential oral insulin.\n\nThrough our subsidiary, Syngene, we offer a suite of integrated, end-to-end discovery and development services for novel molecular entities (NMEs) to the global life sciences sector.\n\nRanked by the prestigious Science magazine among the Top 10 Best employers in the biotech industry, Biocon is passionately pursuing a mission to rationalize healthcare spends, enhance access to life-saving therapies and make a significant impact to global healthcare through ‘blockbuster’ drugs with the potential to benefit a billion patients.",

But they did.\r\n \r\nGuided by humility, compassion and a strong desire to win, the Fishers grew their company thoughtfully. Customers responded.\r\n \r\nToday, Gap Inc. is a leading international specialty retailer with five brands – Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy,  Athleta and INTERMIX – almost 3,200 stores and more than 150,000 employees.\r\n \r\nWe’re growing globally, and just within the last few years, we opened our first stores in China and Italy. We're expanding online shopping to customers, too. Today, customers in about 90 countries can buy our products.  \r\n \r\nWhile many things have changed since 1969, the principles on which we were founded have stayed the same: creativity, delivering results, doing what’s right and always thinking of our customers first.",

        "description": "From a pure-news focused player, NDTV is metamorphosing into a diversified global media player and intends to consistently break new ground.\r\n\r\nNDTV’s tryst with television began way back in 1988, when it produced a news and current affairs show ‘The World This Week’ for the Government-owned broadcaster Doordarshan. The show proved to be immensely popular, and NDTV established its image as a credible private news producer. It moved on to become the sole news content provider and producer for India’s first 24-hour news channel, Star News. The company’s biggest milestone was established in 2003, when it launched two 24-hour news channels— NDTV 24x7 in English and NDTV India in Hindi—followed by a 24-hour business news channel NDTV Profit in 2005, which became a leading business news channel in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the company broke new ground, formulating a strategy to build a global business. NDTV Networks Plc, a subsidiary of NDTV was formed to seize opportunities in areas ‘beyond news’. The Company launched NDTV Imagine (for general entertainment), NDTV Good Times under NDTV Lifestyle Company (for lifestyle content), NDTV Convergence (triple play; to exploit the synergies between television, internet and mobile), NDTV Labs (to develop media software and technology for captive use), NGEN Media Services (outsourcing of media post-production services) as 50:50 joint venture with Genpact and Emerging Markets BV that has helped launch channels in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Middle East.",

        "description": "500 Startups is a global venture capital seed fund with a network of startup programs headquartered in Silicon Valley and is the #1 most active seed fund in the world. \n\n500’s mission is to discover and back the world’s most talented entrepreneurs, help them create successful companies at scale, and build thriving global ecosystems.\n\nWe believe that great founders come in all shades, genders, and nationalities. Since our inception, we’ve made it our mission to find and empower talented founders, whether they’re across the world or overlooked in our own backyard. Diversity has always been a core value at 500. We’re committed to being champions of the global VC community, not as it is, but as we’d like to see it.\n\nStarting a company is not for the faint of heart. Founders must be audacious, innovative, and disruptive. At 500 Startups, we challenge ourselves to also embody those qualities in how we help startups through both our seed fund and our startup accelerator program. In no particular order, that means:\n\n- Building best-in-class resources for usable design, customer-focused metrics, and online distribution\n- Creating a diverse network of experienced and operationally-focused mentors. \n- Partnering with key platform companies and services that will help our startups. \n- Pushing the envelope on how we do investments. \n\nWe typically invest between $25K-$250K USD in our first check, however we also make selective follow-on investments at Series A/B of up to $1M USD. We also aim to be innovative in our investment model. Check out Moneyball for Startups, the inspiration for our investment thesis. \n\n500 Startups is based in San Francisco, California but our companies, mentors, and advisers come from 60+ countries around the world. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. Plus check out our blog for the latest updates! (https://500.co/blog)",

TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.\r\n\r\nTED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. On TED.com, we're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other, both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.\r\n\r\nIn fact, everything we do — from our TED Talks videos to the projects sparked by the TED Prize, from the global TEDx community to the TED-Ed lesson series — is driven by this goal: How can we best spread great ideas?",

Currently, FasterCapital has 20 startups graduated from the incubation program. FasterCapital has invested more than $10.5m in the startups that it has. FasterCapital has already more than 230 companies in its acceleration program. FasterCapital presence is worldwide through more than 192 regional partners who represent FasterCapital in different countries. \n\nWe created FasterCapital because we felt there's a big gap in the industry where only technical entrepreneurs have a chance of entering into incubators. Few entrepreneurs are focusing on smaller opportunities or building solutions for enterprises. FasterCapital's focus is on non-technical entrepreneurs who have good experience in one industry for over five years. Those entrepreneurs are not usually accepted in standard incubation programs and it is difficult for them to find the right technical co-founder. We will empower them by offering everything a standard incubator will offer plus becoming their co-funders and technical co-founders. We will be ready to build the product per equity and we are ready to invest between $200k-$2M per startup. \n\nCurrently, FasterCapital has two main programs: \n- \"Acceleration program\"​ where we help startup in mentoring, business validation and financing \n- \"Incubation program\"​ where we provide all the advantages in acceleration program plus becoming a technical co-founder and co-investing up to 75% of the funding required. FasterCapital offers four round of funding per year where entrepreneurs can submit their startup and those accepted can join our \"acceleration\"​ or \"incubation\"​ programs for free\n\nWe were established in 2010 by the name NextStep Systems. We have validated the model with more than 20 successful startups.",

        "description": "Brave Champs is about the everyday heroes in our lives; the ones that we don’t read about in the newspaper or see them glamorized on the big screen in Hollywood’s latest movies. We are talking about the people that we interact with every single day and that we couldn’t function as a society without. The firemen, doctors, mailmen, trash collectors and others that are working hard every day to make sure we have a high quality of life and that the work that needs done, gets done.\r\n\r\nWe created Brave Champs as a way to show my children as well as other children all over the world, that there are real life heroes in our world that don’t wear capes, fly around the city at night or have superhuman strength and abilities. Children today, are looking for role models and they emulate them everywhere we go. These superheroes they read about and watch on television are no more real than the ones we read about as children in comic books. We want all children to learn about the real heroes of the world and, through Brave Champs, we are able to do just that.",

        "description": "India Glycols Limited (IGL) is a Rs1500-crore diversified chemicals company. The company was established as a single mono-ethylene glycol plant in 1983.IGL’s flagship chemicals division started out with a path-breaking green approach to manufacturing ethylene oxide and derivatives. Using the molasses-ethyl alcohol-ethylene 'green route'​, the company is the only one of its kind in the world. With the emphasis now increasingly shifting to green manufacturing, the chemical division is well poised to meet industry’s need for environmentally responsible products and production techniques. \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the critical dependence on the agricultural feedstock the company has taken up several initiatives including backward integration into sugar manufacturing to ensure seamless raw material availability. Other complementary initiatives include co-opting the cane growing community to ensure cane availability while providing adequate returns to the farmer.\r\n\r\nApart from chemicals, India Glycols has a significant presence in the natural active pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals space with Ennature Biopharma; a well-established natural gum division manufacturing guar gum and a variety of derivatives; a spirits division that manufactures country and India-made foreign liqour adhering to the highest quality standards; and runs Shakumbari Sugar – a well established player in the Indian sugar industry.",

The product range expands from entry level small cars like Alto 800, Alto K10 to the luxury sedan Kizashi that is imported as a CBU. The Company has also added new products like Ertiga (India’s first Life Utility Vehicle) and Celerio with the contemporary Auto Gear Shift technology, to meet the changing lifestyle of its customers.\r\n\r\nMaruti Suzuki is the first company in India to introduce factory fitted CNG vehicles (Eeco, Alto, Estilo, WagonR, SX4 and Ertiga).\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in New Delhi, it has two manufacturing facilities in Haryana - Gurgaon and Manesar.

        "description": "The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was founded in 1909 as a result of the joint efforts of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, the Government of India, and the Maharaja of Mysore. In 1886, Jamsetji Tata conceived of a university of science that would work for the benefit of India, and in 1898 created an endowment for establishing such an institution. The Government of India then took up the effort, and, in consultation with scientists in England and in India, decided to locate the Institute in Bengaluru, where the Maharaja of Mysore, Shri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, donated 372 acres of land. The Institute was formally vested in 1909, the foundation stone was laid in 1911, and the first batch of students started their studies in the same year.\r\n\r\nOver the last century, IISc has become the premier institute for advanced scientific and technological research and education in India. Beginning with 2 departments and 21 students in 1911, today IISc has 39 departments, units, or centres, 3500 students, and about 500 academic and scientific staff, supported by 600 administrative personnel. About 2200 students are in various PhD programs, almost 900 are enrolled for various Masters degrees, whereas about 400 are registered in the newly established, research oriented, four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) programme.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Institute has vigorously promoted interdisciplinary research. New centres such as the CiSTUP, the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems and a new Centre for Brain Research (funded by a large private endowment) are expected to conduct translational research in their respective areas, in order to better connect with industry and society. With the recent construction of modern buildings, acquisition of new research facilities, and induction of a large number of new faculty members, the Institute can look forward to an era of high productivity, increasing impact, and rising prominence in the world.",

        "description": "The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was founded in 1909 as a result of the joint efforts of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, the Government of India, and the Maharaja of Mysore. In 1886, Jamsetji Tata conceived of a university of science that would work for the benefit of India, and in 1898 created an endowment for establishing such an institution. The Government of India then took up the effort, and, in consultation with scientists in England and in India, decided to locate the Institute in Bengaluru, where the Maharaja of Mysore, Shri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, donated 372 acres of land. The Institute was formally vested in 1909, the foundation stone was laid in 1911, and the first batch of students started their studies in the same year.\r\n\r\nOver the last century, IISc has become the premier institute for advanced scientific and technological research and education in India. Beginning with 2 departments and 21 students in 1911, today IISc has 39 departments, units, or centres, 3500 students, and about 500 academic and scientific staff, supported by 600 administrative personnel. About 2200 students are in various PhD programs, almost 900 are enrolled for various Masters degrees, whereas about 400 are registered in the newly established, research oriented, four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) programme.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Institute has vigorously promoted interdisciplinary research. New centres such as the CiSTUP, the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems and a new Centre for Brain Research (funded by a large private endowment) are expected to conduct translational research in their respective areas, in order to better connect with industry and society. With the recent construction of modern buildings, acquisition of new research facilities, and induction of a large number of new faculty members, the Institute can look forward to an era of high productivity, increasing impact, and rising prominence in the world.",
