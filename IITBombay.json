Methodologies of business management are being shorn off the traditional practices and new holistic approaches are being developed.\n\nThese approaches are more at home with the issues that straddle the length and the breadth of ‘The Value Chain’. Today, the constantly changing business environment is characterized with many complex inter-related issues, which need to be addressed.\n\nIn such a scenario, the School believes that premium will be on professionals who are equipped to manage human intellect and imagination, on managers who can provide innovative solutions to problems and on executives who can deliver when required.
