Apicoplast is selected as a target organelle because this particular organelle is essential for parasite’s survival in its various life cycle stages due to the presence of certain important metabolic pathways If they are blocked through drug applications, it will be lethal for parasite. Another aspect on which we are focusing is on proteins involved in Apicoplast division. Equal distribution of Apicoplast during Plasmodium asexual division is mandatory for its survival. However, not much is explored regarding Apicoplast division."},{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=The%20Maharaja%20Sayajirao%20University%20of%20Baroda","schoolName":"The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda","degree":"Master of Science (M.Sc.)","degreeSpec":"Biotechnology, Prion Biology.","dateRange":"2014 – 2016","description":"My M.Sc.

Why C.glabrata? because C.glabrata is the second most common cause of candidiasis after C.albicans .Host cell adhesion of Candida comes under one of the virulence factors which causes pathogenesis. Yeast being a close relative of Candida, its various Adhesion related genes can be extrapolated to Candida spp. i.e. orthologs.  In yeast adhesion related proteins are involved ,there is one adhesion related gene FLO11 which in turn regulated by  MOT3. it is acting as transcription factor in S. cerevisiae that modulates the expression of many genes including FLO11.

Emulsification index, haemolytic activity andCTAB agar plate methods were used to screen the capability of isolates for producing Biosurfactant.Studies were also carried out using diesel, petrol, kerosene and engine oil as hydrocarbon source.Results of the present study suggested that these isolates have potential to use in oil degradation studies.

Such BCIs are possible by capturing and analysing electroencephalography (EEG) based potential responses to various stimuli. BCIs can be used for a host of activities, including cursor control, with spellers, to control wheelchairs and for home automation and control of various devices.

A Mechanical Engineering graduate from BITS PIlani, I hail from Mumbai.\n\nI worked for a year as a Young Manufacturing Professional at Hindalco Industries Limited. I was responsible for studying various plant departments and making recommendations in productivity and sustainability improvements. I prepared Standard Working Instructions (SWIs) for various activities in Mechanical Maintenance. I was also involved in Six Sigma and Asset Reliability projects.\n\nI have been a DAAD exchange student to TU Braunschweig, Germany, where I worked on the Indo-German Collaboration project '3-Cycle'. This involved a Life Cycle Assessment of 3D-printing plastic waste recycling, to produce 3D-printing filament again for further use. I studied the quality of such PLA and ABS filament, comparing it with industrial filament. This process proved to be environmentally beneficial to conventional production.\n\nI have interned at PRS Permacel Pvt Ltd, where I worked out a Low Cost Automation system, which could effectively replace the employment of labour and increase profits. During my stint, I undertook a History Card Analysis for every machine in the manufacturing unit, which could be used to determine its optimum age. I further created a Database of the Warehouse, tracking the inventory in place, to facilitate future orders.\n\nMy flair for Event Planning, Journalism and Analysis is substantiated with my school and college experience. I have recently developed a liking for Case Studies, and wish to improve my skills in this field as well.","firstName":"Tanmayee","lastName":"Kher"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Standard Chartered Bank","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2235/","jobTitle":"Intern","dateRange":"Apr 2018 – Jun 2018","location":"Mumbai Area, India","description":null},{"companyName":"Hindalco Industries Limited","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/81855/","jobTitle":"Young Manufacturing Professional","dateRange":"Jul 2016 – May 2017","location":"Taloja","description":"Responsible for a detailed study of all the plant departments, coming up with\n      suggestions for improvements in productivity and sustainability.
