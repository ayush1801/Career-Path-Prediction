Data and lots of it, viewed/ transformed into the right perspective can enhance human decisions for speed, ease and quality. It is my objective to build systems and products that make this happen.I spent 2.5 years in industry driving change in business processes using algorithms, acquiring an indepth industry perspective. And then I was a graduate research assistant at CMU doing some exciting cutting-edge research in machine learning and data science, acquiring a rigorous academic perspective. It is my hope that in my work at Apple, I will be able to combine the two perspectives to create impactful and amazing technology products!",

We accomplished it using tesseract_ocr with a dynamic zoom level to parse and read from the invoices. Then according to the defined rules in the database, we\ndeveloped a UI to show the entire invoice along with the tax on each purchased item. This\nwas done for almost every supplier they had.\n\n2.

I had the chance to set up and lead a data team, wherein I mentored over 30 volunteers into data science for social good. I am particularly interested in the resonance between real world problems and data-powered solution.My data experience revolves the most around the R programming language, followed by Python. My work in R includes data wrangling(dplyr/tidyverse), visualisation(ggplot), regression modelling, time series analysis, dashboard automation, machine learning and big data operations for Spark(sparklyr) and h2o. A large array of my experience revolves around Tree-based models in Supervised learning(Gradient Boosting, Random Forests and Decision Trees) and Clustering in Unsupervised Learning(kmeans, Hierarchical clustering, Spectral clustering). My Python experience has primarily been for Deep Learning(keras and PyTorch) and Matrix methods and operations. I have also developed a strong interest in manual Python implementations of machine learning algorithms(NumPy, SciPy) such as Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, kmeans, Hierarchical clustering etc in Python to understand and use them better.I built up command over Advanced MS Excel through Pharmaceutical Consulting, Tableau for dashboarding of signals for a major communications firm as well as basic command over SQL through multiple projects.  A large part of my data science experience lies in Healthcare, followed by social data, real estate and communications. However, I am very excited for novel learning opportunities across fields where I can use mathematical, technological, creative and leadership skills in tandem to solve real world problems. I live my life on a quote - â€œThe biggest quality you need as a data scientist is the willingness to feel stupid every single day.â€ Feel free to reach out to chat about anything above, anything that could be above or just as a friendly greeting!",

Abandoned tires are a health hazard, since mosquitoes can breed in the water that accumulates inside them, leading to the spread of many vector-borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue fever, yellow fever etc. \n\nOne of the improvements we made make to the previous attempts is to create a tighter bound for the bounding boxes by deriving an ideal bounding box size in pixels based on flight altitude of the drone and focal length of the camera used. We estimated the flight altitude by making use of the  dimensions of freightliner trucks that are visible in many drone images."

R was the tool of choice to implement generalized non-linear regression modeling for the purpose. My effort was able to come up with better results than 48 other similar efforts.\n\nI also worked in time series prediction of pharmaceutical product sales, where an ARIMA variant implemented in R emerged the final best model. In line with the previous project, this one was better than 50 other similar efforts.\n\nThe project of the largest scale that I worked on here, was one to predict the presence of the 'Pap Smear Test' for Cervical Cancer in the medical history of female patients, based on diverse data such as Physician visits, diagnosis, prescriptions etc. The data was spread out across 11 tables which we hosted on a Teradata Server. The features were engineered using domain knowledge into a total of 684 predictors for 1.5 million female patients and both R and Python were used to model the data, hosted on an AWS server. The well-balanced dataset gave almost 91% accuracy for our prediction model."

Corporate Social Responsibility is an important part of any corporate life today, and it is a way by which any corporate can give back to the society which sustains them, while reaping benefits out of it as well. Since dedicating a separate team just for CSR, commands the use of a lot more resources, a general trend follows the search of collaborations of corporates with NGOs. However, we understood that a very good number of corporates out there in the sphere are facing problems finding a good, right, trustworthy and credible NGO who can take their CSR forward. On the other side of the spectrum, NGOs are in fact, searching for socially responsible and caring parties, to help them take their projects forward, as the funding issues they face are manifold. This scenario suggests that the bridge between the two is foggy. This is where changemaker.be came in. Through us, you and your company could easily find the right NGO to suit your CSR needs and the right project to go along with it, based on your intuition or our suggestions. You had the option of choosing your preferred CSR based on various factors like cause, NGO, location, scale and a lot more.

Right from developing an idea to elaborate brainstorming to uniquely implementing it, the club does it independently.\n\nI joined the club as a member in 2011 and was promoted to the status of core member in 2012. I have been part of 6 major performances of the club over my tenure with 5 of them resulting in standing ovations. I have been part of the first ever shadow act and LED act by the club.

In the quickly changing technological landscape, the organizations collect huge amounts of data on a daily basis and it is indispensable to draw insights from those to add value to them.  As an MS in Business Analytics student at the McCombs School of Business, the University of Texas at Austin, I strive to be a quantitative storyteller. Prior to this, I worked for the Insights and Data Division of Capgemini as a Data Science and Analytics Consultant, improving products and businesses using advanced analytics and programming. I am also a tennis player who has represented state and university teams at several competitions. Furthermore, I have volunteered for an NGO called Campdiaries that nurtures hidden talents in the kids from the underprivileged community. A brief summary of my technological proficiencies: â€¢ Concepts: Predictive Modelling, Data Wrangling & Visualization, Marketing Analytics, Text Analytics â€¢ Programming languages: Python, R, PySparkâ€¢ Database: SQLâ€¢ Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BIâ€¢ Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud, Databricks â€¢ Others: PySpark, IBM SPSS ModelerGithub: https://github.com/sijopkdtowardsdatascience: https://medium.com/@sijopkdKaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sijovm",

The project involved revenue auditing of the three Distribution Companies in Rajasthan, namely, JVVNL, JdVVNL, and AVVNL, located in Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Ajmer, respectively. \n\nHierarchy is as follows:\nDistribution Company -> Zone -> Circle -> Division -> Subdivision \n\nThe goal of the project is to obtain the real figures of what are known as Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. The AT&C loss is itself comprised of two figures, namely, Transmission and Distribution (T&D) loss and Collection Efficiency. The T&D loss could be computed by taking the difference of the Output Energy being fed out from the Distribution Network and the Input Energy being fed into the Distribution Network. The Collection Efficiency, on the other hand, could be computed by rationing what are known as Energy Sales Realization and Energy Sales Assessment. The four key data figures to be analyzed and assimilated in this project are - Input Energy, Energy Sales, Energy Sales Assessment, and Energy Sales Realization.\n\nResponsibilities and Duties included:\n\n- Data Acquisition from the Client Site in Jaipur.\n- Assimilation and Compilation of Management Information System files and Billing Output Reports in MS-Excel as a part of the pre-visit Data Analysis.\n- Routine follow-ups with Assistant Revenue Officers and Assistant Engineers for intimation regarding the audit visits and Data Acquisition at the Subdivision level.\n- Identification of Sundry Cases under a variety of Tariff Codes' heads for which there is a huge discrepancy in the Average Billing Rate figures.\n- Visiting the Subdivisions for Auditing and Analysis of Identified Cases.\n- Data Analysis post the audit visit to compile the final figures in MS-Excel."

Previously, I was serving as a research assistant at the Center for Computation and Cognition (CCC), Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Goethe University in Frankfurt under the supervision of Prof. Visvanathan Ramesh and Mr. Martin Mundt. I was broadly working on deep learning for computer vision at that time. My specific areas of research were deep neural architecture search using reinforcement learning, continual learning, deep generative replay, Bayesian inference, and statistical outlier detection and rejection. My time at CCC was very rewarding and I managed to jointly publish conference and workshop papers at CVPR 2019, ICCV 2019, and NeurIPS 2018. Even before that, I had spent four wonderful years at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani) before graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electronics and Instrumentation in July 2018.I am interested in machine learning (ML), specifically using deep learning and/or reinforcement learning to solve problems in computer vision and natural language understanding.  I am also open to working in data science projects. I am actively looking for internship opportunities in core ML or data science. If you have any offer, feel free to contact me.",

          "description": "During the first half of the year-long research assitantship, I jointly worked with my mentors on curating the novel COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage (CODEBRIM) dataset for multi-target classification of five commonly appearing concrete defects and background. We compared two meta-learning approaches to find suitable convolutional neural network architectures for this challenging multi-class multi-target task. We observed that learned architectures have less overall parameters in addition to yielding better multi-target accuracy in comparison to best-in-practice CNN architectures from literature evaluated in the context of our application. We published a paper at the main conference of CVPR 2019. \n\nI also got an opportunity to investigate a common trend of montonically incrementing feature amount with depth in a convolutional neural network (CNN). Several architectures with the same total feature amount but with different distributions of features across layers were trained and their performance vis-a-vis a certain task was compared. The comparison resulted in some interesting observations which questioned the afore-mentioned common practice. I co-authored a paper from this investigation at the NeurIPS CRACT 2018 workshop.\n\nLater during my time as an RA, my mentors and I worked on the problem of robust continual learning with deep generative replay and statistical outlier detection. We used variational autoencoders with a classifier sitting the latent embedding, to learn to make class-specific latent clusters and continually generate previously seen image data. We modified the OpenSet algorithm to provide confidence bounds vis-a-vis the generated data actually belonging to the old data distribution, by exploiting the class-specific posteriors. This resulted in a system that can keep generating high-quality data and continually learn new tasks while retaining old knowledge.  A workshop paper from this work was published at ICCV SDLCV 2019 workshop."

          "description": "In this project, I designed a principled image recognition system that uses neural graph matching between model and image planes, and Gabor filters for feature extraction. The system involves a dynamic two-dimensional graph with Gabor filter stacks (corresponding to different orientations and frequencies) at each node. The dynamic nature of the graph (dynamic link architecture) allows for global positioning of the whole grid corresponding to the center of gravity of the object to be recognized and local restricted movements of the nodes to account for local translations of object pixels and rotation of the grid and individual Gabor wavelets to offset the non-zero orientation, if any, of the object under consideration. This leads to rotation and tranlation invariance of the system. This dynamic image graph us then matched against stored model graphs and the model graph with the best match gives the identity/label of the object recognized. I published a paper on MNIST recognition at JCP 2018."

          "description": "In a mobile mapping system, a global positioning system (GPS) measures time and acquires the global coordinates (Cartesian or Azimuthal) very precisely with the help of satellites while the terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) records the local coordinates at the point of measurement. Although the TLS has a clock for measuring time, the least count of it is in milliseconds which renders it less precise when compared with the time measurement by the GPS where the precision is in nanoseconds. Effective synchronisation is required in this case where the data points produced by the TLS can be mapped to the data points produced by the GPS with the timestamps as reference. Hence, it is necessary to pass the timestamp information from the GPS to the TLS at every point of measurement to succesfully map data points from the two devices. I solved this problem by using a third computer which used dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and network control protocol (NCP) to interact with the GPS (NCP) and the TLS (DHCP). I wrote C++ code using proprietary RivLib libraries from the TLS manufacturer and bash scripts on the third computer for timestamp transfer. Besides, I used LibScan libraries and wrote C++ code for extraction of TLS data into a human-readable format (comma separated values). I presented a paper from this work at the techinal festival of BITS Pilani, APOGEE, and won the second prize in that category."

Contributed in developing process improvements within the FC to reduce the defects in the processes of slamming, picking and packing, and decrease the DPMO contributed which would lead to a reduction in the scrap created in these processes. Developed methods to inculcate an attitude of taking up the data of defects and their causes on a regular basis and showing bias for action leading to the reduction in the number of defects.\n\n2. Diversion of small ASINs from single non-sort picking\n\nIdentified the change in configuration that is required to divert the ASINs from a tough process path, which were demanding NP9 box recommendation to improve the pack productivity. As a consequence, during CPT times, the search for small items which were always lost among the large items was lessened. This also resulted in a decrease in box deviations.\n\n3. Pack productivity improvement and cost savings by modifying the box recommendations\n\nDid regular deep dives through the data of slam wrong box in FPY portal which helped to filter out the certification opportunities. Gone through the data of the grotesque ASINs on a regular basis and test them for SIOC, polybag and custom box.

I had been involved in two projects at this institute, the details of which are as follows:\n\nâœ¦  \"We didn't run out of planes, or television sets. We ran out of food\" ~ Interstellar (2014)\nThere exists extra-ordinary potential in the betterment of current agricultural practices by the application of knowledge in various fields of computer science like AI, IoT, Data mining and more..., so as to serve the rising global population better. Under the guidance of Dr. Shashikant Sadistap (Sr. Principal Scientist & Head, Agri-electronics group), I worked on a project focused on, \"Big Data Analytics in Precision agriculture\". Hadoop, Map-reduce and tensor flow were some of the technologies that were used for the study.\n\nâœ¦  UAVs are increasingly used for surveillance, fire detection, mapping, cartography, landslide monitoring, inspection, traffic monitoring, search and rescue etc. It is important for many of the aforementioned applications to perceive the scene in real-time. My second project at CEERI was related to object detection and recognition in aerial images taken from UAVs/MAVs; using the traditional approach viz-a-viz using a deep learning approach. It was supervised by Dr. Somsukla Maiti."

The heart adds a beat, like a quiet exclamation point on the experience. Within a 10th of a second the reaction has passed, but not without leaving its mark. Someone found what theyâ€™re looking for. Does your content generate impulses to act? It can. Try Pepperâ€I am a final year undergraduate at BITS Pilani. I started Pepper a year and a half back. We envision to be the one-stop destination for content creation for vernacular, voice and video. We are currently creating the largest curated community of content creators in India through an AI-enabled platform.Over the past year, while managing college outside, I have successfully been able to build a team of 15 people and a network of 17500+ content creators which are creating content for over 150+ brands in India. From a completely bootstrapped model, I have been able to convert this to a profitable business by having raised revenues over $150,000 so far and have impending deals of $100,000 for the next few months. I love this quote, \"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!â€ If youâ€™re interested in grabbing a coffee and talking shop (or to hear how we almost missed creating a world record in college), please send an email my way at - anirudh.singla@pepper.org.in",

All were as part of micro-services.\n \nThe Information Retrieval system involved retrieving necessary news articles, given a query. This was done by computing sentence representations given individual word representations, and ranking the article based on the similarity between query and the sentence representations of a particular article.\n\nThe embeddings were created through a combination of neural network models i.e., an ensemble of models(Character CNN + BiLSTM) implemented in tensorflow. This kind of model helped in capturing the semantic + syntactic + context(depending on sentence) for a particular word. The model states were also initialised with pre-trained states(graph initialisation) of the same model trained on general datasets so that they have a greater general domain understanding.\n\nInvolved in understanding and writing training scripts for stance detection models to detect if two pieces of articles have the same view points regarding a particular topic. The model trained had Tree-LSTMs for syntactic parsing through text which helped in the task of predicting stance between two sentences."

Here, I work to build, deploy and monitor backend related software.\n\nWhile working here, I learned to communicate and collaborate with a team of fellow student developers to produce code that would help run all of the fests at BITS Pilani, and increase their revenue. It was also here that I discovered the joy of Linux systems administration and devops.\n\nDuring OASIS '18 I worked on developing an e-wallet which fest participants and university students could use to order food from stalls by prepaying with cash or by withdrawing money from their student accounts (would be added to the student's end of semester fees). This was combined with a ticket purchasing and QR based entry system for the fest's shows, the backend and API for which I also developed.\n\nLater during APOGEE '19, I overhauled the e-wallet and tickets manager codebases based on what I learnt from deploying the OASIS  '18 code in a live environment.\n\nThe overhaul included:\n1. Increasing the modularity and readablilty.\n2. Increasing efficiency by reducing the number of network calls executed.\n3. Adding a test suite to test core functionality.\n4. Adding documentation to make things easier for fellow developers on the app/frontend side."

Along with these, I was completely unfamiliar with Swift Programming Language and its conventions, so I had to quickly learn it and with high standards in order to adhere strictly to Googleâ€™s style guidelines.\n- These tutorials will be used as the official educational resources for the \"Swift for TensorFlow\" ecosystem. Some of these notebooks could further be used in a future course, specifically targeted at mobile app developers (\"Intro to Machine Learning with S4TF\").\n- Collaborated efficiently with Mentors - Brad Larson, Paige Bailey, Richard Wei through daily mails, weekly blog posts and monthly Video Chats for constant communication and guidance.\n- Medium Blog: https://medium.com/gsoc-19"

        "description": "Getting to the bottom of everything may be a tough task, a task which takes long hours of research over the Internet, reading in between the lines and coming up with new insights which nobody generally notices. But as a die-hard critical thinker, this has been my lifelong passion.My passionate curiosity towards anything I come across and the thirst to understand its nuances leads me to seek engaging conversations with my acquaintances, forcing us to brainstorm over various topics of shared interests. I used my abilities to my best in professional quizzing, cracking difficult questions with the help of my quizzing partners, in front of a large audience, under high pressure. But then I decided to pause. This quest for knowledge made me learn the basics everything under the sun from Theology to Geology. I need to specialize! Where can I use my knowledge to the benefit of humanity?According to me, the two levers of the world which decide the fate of humanity on a larger scale is :a. Credit, access to Credit and availability/flow of Capital b. Management of People/Resources and its AdministrationHmmm. It all makes sense! In all my internships, I made use of my passion to deliver favorable outcomes to all the organizations where I have been employed. And most of what I did at BITS Pilani revolved around my passion and the two levers. Now, all that I need is a full-time opportunity (and yes, a mentor to teach the ropes) to utilize my full potential. Would it be you?",

Simulation saves us from the effort of setting up electrical poles and/or transformers in real geographical locations which can be very tiresome and expensive. Our main aim in this project has been to provide an user-friendly interface for such simulation. This can be helpful in optimizing the network flow which in turn can be crucial in setting up real-time poles in useful areas such that the network flow stays optimized and electric flow is not hindered. The delivered prototype works well.\nOn completion of the project we completed the Innovation challenge and hence were provided with a scholarship.\n\nResponsibilities and Tasks completed:\n1. Conducted survey and collected data pertaining to each node (electric pole) in an electrical\nnetwork for a given city.\n2. Created an user friendly Geo-Electrical network Simulation tool (in a team of three) to analyze and\nvisualize real time changes made into the electrical survey data and look for possible ways to\noptimize the network\n3. The code was written in JavaScript and Python. PgAdmin, Postgres, PostGIS were some out of\nthe many tools used in completing the task.\n4. We did this project in collaboration with Gujarat Power Research and Development Cell, a\ndepartment under the supervision of the government of Gujarat\n\nAchievements:\nWas awarded the BISAG Innovation Challenge scholarship upon completing the task.\nWas awarded a strong Letter of Recommendation from Dr. Manoj Pandya, a senior project\nscientist and an excellent project manager at BISAG."
