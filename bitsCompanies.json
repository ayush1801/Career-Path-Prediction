        "description": "Quark is the annual technical festival of BITS, Pilani - K. K. Birla Goa Campus. One of the biggest festivals of its kind in India, Quark, usually organized in early February, witnesses strong participation, generally running into thousands. Quark has been a major technical festival in the country since its inception. From its modest beginnings in 2006, Quark morphed into a national-level festival in its 2008 version. Since then, Quark has consistently seen participation from all leading colleges across India. Quark usually features various events pertaining to the different engineering branches as well as the pure sciences.\n\nThe Quark logo highlights how Quark as a festival will never stop growing. The spirit of innovation and progress is reflected in the way Quark has constantly brought something new and wonderful to offer. In lieu of this, the left half of the new logo appears like a blueprint or something always under construction. The right half shows the developed Quark, depicting the fiery passion, unity and teamwork, and thought and creativity, all of which goes into making Quark the tremendous success that it always is.\n\nThe Quark banner is synonymous with innovation, as each edition boasts of events, guest lectures, workshops and special nights surpassing the ingenuity and grandeur of its predecessors. With a plethora of events to cater to students of varied backgrounds and disciplines, including a lecture by the eminent former president Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, Nobel Laureates like Sir Harry Kroto and Douglas Osheroff, events like the BITS Model United Nations and a number of diverse workshops organized by various eminent associations. Quark has carved a niche for itself as one of the biggest technical fests in India.",

Back then, our catalogue featured just 35 designs, but to our customers they signified infinite possibilities. The same table, the same chair was used completely differently by different people. This told us something. People like their homes to be unique. \r\nToday, we realise we’re here not just to sell well-designed products. We’re here to help you create spaces that mirror who you are. Our new brand identity is a reflection of this renewed purpose. It’s a celebration of the creative spirit that makes each of us and our homes different.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATIVITY IS FOR EVERYONE \r\nMost of us think of creativity as something rare. Something only a few are blessed with. In reality though, there’s nothing more ordinary than creativity. \r\n\r\nTo be creative simply means to create. And that’s something we do all the time. \r\nWe tell stories even if we’re not writers. We think new thoughts even if we’re not thinkers. We experiment with recipes even if we’re not chefs. And we create spaces even if we’re not designers. \r\nAt Urban Ladder, we want you to discover the joy of creating. Starting with your home",

BITS Pilani has consistently ranked amongst the top universities in India.

The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.\n\nAdmission is merit-based, as assessed by the online BITSAT examination. The fully residential institute is privately supported.",

Thereafter, several life-saving biologicals were manufactured at prices affordable to the common man and in abundance, with the result that the country was made self-sufficient for Tetanus Anti-toxin and Anti-snake Venom serum, followed by DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) group of Vaccines and then later on MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) group of vaccines.\n\nThe Philanthropic philosophy of the company still not only exists but has been proliferated to bring down the prices of newer vaccines such as Hepatitis-B vaccine, Combination vaccine etc., so that not only Indian's, but the entire under-privileged children of the world are protected from birth onwards.",

BITS Pilani has consistently ranked amongst the top universities in India. The acceptance rate of BITS Pilani is 1.47% making it the most selective university in India.\n\nThe primary motive of BITS is to \"train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information\"​. The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.\n\nAdmission is merit-based, as assessed by the online BITSAT examination. The fully residential institute is privately supported.",

With over 10,000 exclusive hotels in its chain, OYO is one of a kind and has pioneered the world’s first full stack technology led hospitality model. Its network includes major metros, regional business hubs, top leisure destinations as well as pilgrimage towns. \n \nOYO was founded by Ritesh Agarwal, the first resident Asian to be accepted to the Thiel Fellowship (started by Paypal founder Peter Thiel). He was featured in Forbes 30 under 30 in Consumer Tech (2016) for creating a global disruptor. OYO was recently chosen as India’s Most Promising Hotel Network (HolidayIQ Better Holiday Awards 2017) and has received several accolades including Express IT Startup of the Year Award (2015), NDTV Dream Chaser of the Year (2016) and IAMAI Digital Startup of the Year (2016).

OYO is backed by leading global investors, including the SoftBank Group, Lightspeed India, Sequoia Capital and Greenoaks Capital.\n\nOYO revolutionalized the fragmented and legacy-driven budget hospitality space in India by enabling standardization of services, amenities and in-room experience. Through the use of its proprietary apps for inventory-management, room-service, revenue-management and customer-relationship management, OYO has delivered predictable, affordable and available budget-room accommodation to millions of travellers in India.\n\nIn January 2017, OYO launched Townhouse - a managed hotel-brand designed to function as a social hotspot to cater to city dwellers and a new generation of guests. \nOYO Townhouse - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVMQgODN9KI\n\nFor more information log on to www.oyorooms.com \nDownload our app from oyoroo.ms/app\nCheck out our blog at oyorooms.com/blog",

        "description": "The Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani is a prestigious Indian university for higher education in science, technology and humanities. BITS Pilani has consistently ranked amongst the top universities in India. The acceptance rate of BITS Pilani is 1.47% making it the most selective university in India.\n\nThe primary motive of BITS is to \"train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information\"​. The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.\n\nAdmission is merit-based, as assessed by the online BITSAT examination. The fully residential institute is privately supported.",

This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector.

        "description": "Gas Turbine Research Centre (GTRC) took its birth at No.4 BRD Air Force Station, Kanpur in 1959 with 8 Engineers / Scientists and about 20 Technicians. Its first indigenously developed centrifugal type gas turbine engine of 1000 kg thrust was tested in 1961. GTRC was moved to Bangalore, brought under the banner of DRDO, and was re-named as GTRE in November 1961.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nGTRE proceeded to design and develop the GTX series of engines with flat rating concept which was successfully demonstrated.  Initial sanction for the development of GTX-35-VS was given in  1989  and  christened  as  KAVERI  engine  in  the  first  Aero  Engine  Development  Board Meeting.  Three full engines and two core engines were successfully tested to prove the concept.\nWith  redesigned  compressor,  six  full  engines  and  one  core  engine  were  built  and successfully tested at altitude conditions and the performance evaluated. The marine version of this engine for the Navy was conceived and the first prototype was successfully integrated and tested at Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam.\nKaveri  prototype  engines  were  subjected  to  Acceptance  Test  Procedures  (ATP)  at  GTRE, before sending them to Moscow, Russia for Altitude Test and Flying Test Bed (FTB) trials.\n\n73 hours of Altitude Testing was conducted at Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM), Russia in 2009-10 and the performance and operability of the engine were verified. 57 hours of Flight Tests were completed in IL-76 aircraft at Russia covering altitude up to 12 km and Mach no. 0.7 in 2010-11.  About 2900 hours of testing completed at ground and altitude conditions as on date.\nGTRE is at present working on eight Technology projects and one AR&DB project titled 'Gas Turbine Enabling Technology (GATET)'​.  GTRE is an ISO 9001:2008 certified establishment.",

        "description": "The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was founded in 1909 as a result of the joint efforts of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, the Government of India, and the Maharaja of Mysore. In 1886, Jamsetji Tata conceived of a university of science that would work for the benefit of India, and in 1898 created an endowment for establishing such an institution. The Government of India then took up the effort, and, in consultation with scientists in England and in India, decided to locate the Institute in Bengaluru, where the Maharaja of Mysore, Shri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, donated 372 acres of land. The Institute was formally vested in 1909, the foundation stone was laid in 1911, and the first batch of students started their studies in the same year.\r\n\r\nOver the last century, IISc has become the premier institute for advanced scientific and technological research and education in India. Beginning with 2 departments and 21 students in 1911, today IISc has 39 departments, units, or centres, 3500 students, and about 500 academic and scientific staff, supported by 600 administrative personnel. About 2200 students are in various PhD programs, almost 900 are enrolled for various Masters degrees, whereas about 400 are registered in the newly established, research oriented, four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) programme.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Institute has vigorously promoted interdisciplinary research. New centres such as the CiSTUP, the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems and a new Centre for Brain Research (funded by a large private endowment) are expected to conduct translational research in their respective areas, in order to better connect with industry and society. With the recent construction of modern buildings, acquisition of new research facilities, and induction of a large number of new faculty members, the Institute can look forward to an era of high productivity, increasing impact, and rising prominence in the world.",

With his vision of proactive philanthropy and approach to ‘giving’, the Trusts catalyse societal development while ensuring that initiatives and interventions have a contemporary relevance to the nation. \r\n\r\nPhilanthropy that's making a real difference...\r\n\r\nSince its inception, the Tata Trusts have played a pioneering role in transforming traditional ideas of charity and introducing the concept of philanthropy to make a real difference to communities.

The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.\n\nAdmission is merit-based, as assessed by the online BITSAT examination.

        "description": "We are a technology start-up building the future of communication. \n\nVoice calling has been the staple of distance communication since the first phone call in 1876. We believe that the calling experience for users has stayed more or less unchanged for past decades, and is simply a remnant of a time when the internet did not exist, making it very archaic and lacking in key benefits of the 21st century. We're working to fix it. \n\nIn our mission to help people communicate more efficiently, we have decided to build a calling platform - QTalk - that goes beyond just Voice and Video calling and empowers users with the tools to engage with each other in ways analogous to how they would interact in the real world. How often do you you meet a friend or family member and just look at each other and talk? No, you immerse yourselves in a shared reality, watching a video together, listening to music, playing games, and eating. QTalk aims to give you the same experience through the window of your smartphone. \n\nIt promises to be a fun ride. Come join us!

Our current focus is on improving access to high-quality, affordable education for students who cannot attend school on a regular basis or whose school doesn’t provide them with a satisfactory learning experience.\n\nThe Oppia community works to develop and widely distribute effective, enjoyable online lessons in key subjects that reach millions of people who otherwise lack the necessary resources to learn the material. We want every individual, no matter what their personal circumstances, to have access to learning experiences that are not only pedagogically effective, but also fun and empowering.\n\nOppia’s unique technology simulates an interactive tutor, adapting each lesson to an individual learner’s needs with specific feedback and hints to help them improve. The platform is designed to allow lessons to be supplemented with subtitles in students’ native languages. Lessons are openly licensed and the platform is entirely open-source, enabling a diverse group of collaborators from around the world to make regular iterative improvements.",

        "description": "About UrbanClap\nUrbanClap (www.urbanclap.com | Android App | iOS App) is India's largest home services marketplace. The platform helps customers book reliable home services – from beauty services to fitness training, appliance repair to plumbing etc. Since its inception in 2014, UrbanClap has built a network of 50,000+ trained service professionals, and served over 2 million customers across major metropolitan cities of India and Dubai.\n\nCompany's vision\nUrbanClap's vision is to empower 1 million+ service professionals to become micro service entrepreneurs. Prior to joining UrbanClap, most of these professionals, be it plumbers, beauticians, carpenters etc., would typically earn INR 10-15k per month, working for a local shop, aggregator or as a freelancer. The UrbanClap platform enables these professionals to become micro-entrepreneurs by helping them in 5 key areas –\n\nCustomer Access & Brand\n●    Working as an individual franchisee of UrbanClap\n●    Access to a steady stream of customer orders, forming >80% of the service professional's business, if not 100%\nFinancing & Insurance\n●    Opening bank accounts, access to loans for upfront kits, 2-wheelers, home etc. \n●    Life and Accidental Insurance Programs\nTech-Led Standardization\n●    Standardizing the service - creating SKUs, fixed and transparent pricing, clear service deliverables, defined SOPs, delivery tracking, payment systems, reviews etc., to help remove friction from the service experience\nTraining & Certification\n●    Soft and Core Skills Training imparted in our training centers and via the app\nProduct Procurement\n●    Purchasing consumables (Spares, cosmetics, paints etc.) needed for service delivery in bulk\n \nThis helps service professionals become more organized, and multiplies their earnings. E.g. - Our beauticians typically earn INR 40 to 50k per month with no upper ceiling (Many earn > INR 100k per month), while in the local salons, they would earn between INR 8 to 15k per month\n\nMore on the company's vision and culture can be explored through the videos hosted here - https://careers.urbanclap.com/\n \nScale of Operations\nUrbanClap serves approximately 300,000 customers every month, for a variety of their home services needs. It is present in all major metropolitan cities of India, and has recently also ventured into Dubai. The company is on annual GMV run-rate of > INR 500 Cr., and a revenue run-rate of > INR 100 Cr. annualized (80%+ contribution margin). The business is growing rapidly, scaling at 3-4x YoY, supported by a strong balance sheet and a clear path to profitability",

Definitions, examples and formulae are covered in a way that is not only easy to remember but also builds curiosity.\r\n\r\nVideo Problem Books : Video problem-books capture the example problems with visuals of a notebook and sound bites from the teacher. The teacher guides the learner through various ways of tackling the problem from the beginning.\r\n\r\nIntensive Teacher Training : Training covers aspects like subject matter, content production, content delivery, soft skills and software skills. Apart from access to high quality training, teachers who associate with us get rewards not only for their contribution to content, but also on their students’ performance.\r\n\r\nClassroom Material : We provide teacjers with material which is extremely student-centric in nature. It covers revision, extended exposition, refutation and discussion. The material is delivered online to the teachers in the classroom and includes new age material that engages students. \r\n\r\nMonitoring Apps : \r\n\r\nFor Teachers - Firstmate® is an app that helps teachers deliver adaptive content in the classroom and takes care of the grunt work. \r\n\r\nFor Students - Edflix® is an intelligent app that captures student-behaviour data as they watch the Video Books at home. It then crunches the data to tailor the best suited line-up of new-age content delivered by the teacher in the classroom.",

BITS Pilani has consistently ranked amongst the top universities in India. The acceptance rate of BITS Pilani is 1.47% making it the most selective university in India.\n\nThe primary motive of BITS is to \"train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information\"​. The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes the maturing of Indian technical ability and \"can-do\"​ entrepreneurial spirit, especially as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.\n\nAdmission is merit-based, as assessed by the online BITSAT examination. The fully residential institute is privately supported.",

The technological services of the institute are as durable as leather. Leather and allied research in CLRI form core areas of activities. There is critical strength for research and development in some critical areas of sciences and technology. Research in CLRI includes non-leather as well. \n\nCLRI Mandate\n\nTo seek excellence in research in Frontier areas\nTo serve the national apex body in leather\nTo Participate in HRD through direct role in education and training in leather related areas\nTo assess and forecast technology needs\nTo serve as a reliable consultant to leather sector\nTo develop technologies and deliver to the industry through effective extension network\nTo serve as a dependable source of technologies and\nTo provide a technology supermarket for users",

BITS Pilani consists of 15 academic departments with a focus on education in engineering and the sciences.The institute was established in its present form in 1964 with a vision to realize Jawaharlal Nehru’s project of nation-building with its emphasis on \"science, technology and modernization\"​ . At that time, its transformation from a regional engineering college to a national university was backed by the Ford Foundation and G.D.Birla. MIT provided the technical assistance that was required for this transformation.\r\n\r\nThe institute has developed and administers the all-India computerized entrance test BITSAT (BITS Admission Test), which is the first of its kind in India. The admission is on the basis of merit (as assessed by the BITSAT Examination) and not through any kind of reservation. The institute is privately supported and fully residential.\r\n\r\nThe institute has strong linkages with industry, as can be seen by its off-campus Work Integrated Learning Program(WILP) which enrolled 19,000 students from corporate enterprises in 2009. Practical experience in the industry is in the curriculum as a \"Practice School\"​ program, where students work with companies throughout India.\r\n\r\nBITS has campuses in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) , Goa (India), Hyderabad (India) and an extension center in Bangalore (India).",

We’ve been true to that purpose since brothers Henry and Richard Bloch founded our company in 1955. Since then, we’ve prepared approximately 800 million tax returns and grown to have approximately 12,000 offices throughout the United States and around the world. We know that tax needs and situations change from year to year. That’s why we offer new and innovative ways to prepare and file taxes so clients can choose what suits them best.\n\nWe are a people company first and a tax company second. With this in mind, we deliver care in every interaction, conversation, and at each touchpoint. That’s how we build long-lasting relationships with clients, communities, and associates.\n\nPeople who join H&R Block say it feels like being part of something bigger. A place with an amazing and storied history, but with a strong and urgent focus on the future. Maybe it's because our company still has the feeling of ‘family’ serving as the foundation for our associates and franchisees who bring our purpose to life each day. Maybe it’s how determined, forward thinking and innovative we are, or how accessible our leadership is. We believe it’s all those things, and much more. \n\nOur ideas are rooted in unique and diverse perspectives fueled by curiosity and creativity. We’re not afraid to try new things, and never rest on past success. We are passionate in the way we advocate for each other, for our clients, and most importantly, we not only say we are better together…we truly believe it!",

Since 2010, we have been developing and disseminating self- learning content, games and apps for differently- abled students.\n\nOur founder, Abhishek Syal, invented a multi-patent pending map and diagram reader for the visually challenged children in India. While working on his research from 2006- 2010, he realized that his work was enabling self-learning for the visually challenged children. This motivated him and the founding team to launch a non-profit platform to create, develop and disseminate self-educational resources for these children. Thus began the development of Special Education Modules (SEMs) for the visually challenged.\n\nOur visions of innovative technology transformed into a mission to make a difference. We are committed to transforming the learning process of visually challenged children through our innovative technology, resources and aids. We strive to instill confidence, spark interest, impact learning and empower the differently-abled.\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of the SEMs that transformed the lives of over 1,500 individuals, ARISE Impact is now focusing on developing and disseminating technology that will have direct impacts on employability outcomes among the visually impaired.",

        "description": "About TEDx, x = independently organized event\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)\n\nAbout TED:\nTED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 25 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. The annual TED Conference invites the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes. Their talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Al Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Long Beach, California, along with the TEDActive simulcast in Palm Springs; the annual TEDGlobal conference is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nTED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily, the recently launched TED-Ed platform for students and educators, the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide, and TEDBooks, short e-books by speakers that elaborate on a single idea originally presented on TED's stage.",
