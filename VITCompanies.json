        "description": "123 years ago, in central Calcutta an intrepid baker made a batch of delicious, golden brown biscuits. These were meant for officers of the British Raj and their families, people used to the exacting standards of English tea-time snacking. From the paeans of ecstasy for that first batch of aromatic, flavour-some biscuits was born a long tradition of delectable baking - and its Indian custodian, Britannia.\r\n\r\nOver the last century and a quarter, Britannia has been serving the Indian consumer with a range of fresh, nutritious and flavour-rich products. We deliver a complete sensory experience, in every product, every time.\r\n\r\nToday, Britannia is a leading food company in India with over Rs. 6000 crores in revenues, delivering products in over 5 categories through 3.5 million retail outlets to more than half the Indian population. Our core emphasis across portfolios is on healthy, fresh and delicious food and we are the First Zero Trans-fat Company in India. 50% of our product portfolio is enriched with micro-nutrients. Britannia was one of the first companies in India to pioneer category defining innovations. Our relentless focus on quality and freshness has won us prestigious accolades including the Golden Peacock National Quality Award and the Ramakrishna Bajaj National Quality Award. However, the award that we cherish the most is the one given by our consumers.Britannia is recognized as one of the most trusted, valuable and popular brands among Indian consumers in various reputed surveys.\r\n\r\nWe realize our responsibility to continue delivering fresh, nutritious and fun products and it is our mission to be an arm-stretch away, any time of the day.\r\n\r\nSo, the next time you imagine the aroma of oven-fresh cakes, the tantalizing drop of rich chocolate cream on crisp, cocoa-brown cookies, the satisfying mouthful of crunchy biscuits or a sinful bite of melted cheese on freshly toasted bread, imagine Healthy Goodness. \r\n\r\nImagine Britannia.",

Looking back, CLRI seems a worthwhile investment of India in a sensitive industrial segment of a Nation.\n\nCLRI has emerged as a global leader in leather research. The technological services of the institute are as durable as leather. Leather and allied research in CLRI form core areas of activities. There is critical strength for research and development in some critical areas of sciences and technology. Research in CLRI includes non-leather as well. \n\nCLRI Mandate\n\nTo seek excellence in research in Frontier areas\nTo serve the national apex body in leather\nTo Participate in HRD through direct role in education and training in leather related areas\nTo assess and forecast technology needs\nTo serve as a reliable consultant to leather sector\nTo develop technologies and deliver to the industry through effective extension network\nTo serve as a dependable source of technologies and\nTo provide a technology supermarket for users",

        "description": "Lenders targeting the underserved are unable to achieve optimum productivity because of paper and excel based processes that are carried out by semi-literate field agents. Poor data quality makes it difficult to gather insights to improve performance, create new financial products, and enhance customer experience. \n\nArtoo believes the best way to effectively scale financial inclusion is to implement cutting-edge technology which empowers the field agent instead of replacing him.\n \nWithin the unbanked population, Artoo has chosen to focus on small businesses, the largest and the fastest growing segment of the economy, which generates the greatest employment. It is also where Artoo can add the greatest customer value.\n \nUnlike traditional lending systems which tend to work at the backend, relying on paper at the frontend, Artoo provides comprehensive digitalisation at the borrower's doorstep. And since that is where the most data points are, it is able to more effectively impact the customer's business. Also unlike FinTechs that provide Big Data underwriting, Artoo has the intelligence to understand the nuances of small businesses, while meeting all compliance standards.\n \nWe have disbursed loans worth $200+ Million and assessed 300,000 small businesses on our platform. Client enterprises have achieved 500% improvement in productivity, 43% reduction in loan processing times, and a 45% reduction in customer acquisition costs by using Artoo. Overall this has resulted in an 800% ROI.",

CAG believes that accountability and good governance are pivotal for the progress of any nation.

Members of CAG belong to institutes like IITs, IIMs, Stanford University, Cornell University etc. and have served organizations like McKinsey, All India Radio, J P Morgan, The Indian Express, Boston Consulting Group etc.\r\n\r\nAs an organization, CAG envisions an Indian democracy that is truly representative of its people and their aspirations. To make this vision possible, CAG aims to actively pursue the long-term goal of strengthening accountable governance in India. In our journey so far, we have graduated from testing the political landscape of the nation into believing that India's citizens need to play a more decisive role in deciding the nation's trajectory. In the upcoming 2014 General Elections, CAG sees an opportunity to make a credible impact. The opportunity is open for the citizens of India to help in bringing a government which is accountable and takes India to its rightful place.\r\n\r\nEnthused by the response of its first event, the Young Indian Leaders Conclave, CAG organized Manthan: Indiaâ€™s biggest youth movement to help set the agenda for 2014 General Elections and Chai pe Charcha: Common man discussing local issues at 1000 locations with Shri Narendra Modi .CAG envisions itself as building a mass volunteer network spread across the length and breadth of the nation towards furthering the cause of accountable governance in India.",

        "description": "Tata Teleservices Limited spearheads the Tata Groupâ€™s presence in the telecom sector. The Tata Group includes over 100 companies, over 450,000 employees worldwide and more than 3.8 million shareholders.\r\n\r\nIncorporated in 1996, Tata Teleservices Limited was the pioneer of the CDMA 1x technology platform in India, embarking on a growth path after the acquisition of Hughes Tele.com (India) Ltd [renamed Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Limited] by the Tata Group in 2002. Over the last few years, the company has launched significant services CDMA mobile operations in January 2005 under the brand name Tata Indicom, market-defining wireless mobile broadband services under the brand name Tata Photon in 2008 and 2G GSM services under the brand name Tata DOCOMO in 2009.\r\nTata Teleservices Limited also has a significant presence in the 2G GSM space, through its joint venture with NTT DOCOMO of Japan, and offers differentiated products and services. Tata DOCOMO was born after Tata Groupâ€™s strategic alliance with Japanese telecom major NTT DOCOMO in November 2008. Tata DOCOMO received a pan-India license to operate GSM telecom services and rolled out GSM services in all the 18 telecom Circles where it received spectrum from the Government of India in the quick span of just over a year.\r\n\r\nOne of the key milestones in October 2011 was the brand integration exercise at TTL, which saw the Companyâ€™s many brands being consolidated under its single flagship brand, Tata DOCOMO. This helped TTL leverage the benefits of brand synergies and capitalize on its vast retail and distribution network, which is the largest amongst all private telecom operators in the country.\r\nTata DOCOMO marks a significant milestone in the Indian telecom landscape, and has already redefined the very face of telecoms in India, being the first to pioneer the per-second tariff option part of its â€˜Pay for What You Useâ€™ pricing paradigm.",

With a proud tradition as a provider of innovative teaching and learning and a focus on impactful research, the university has established a robust reputation for pushing the boundaries of higher education regionally, nationally and across the world.\n\nThrough its links with leading-edge businesses and organizations in a variety of countries and industries, Coventry Universityâ€™s 29,000+ students enjoy access to placements and international opportunities which ensure that their employment prospects are enhanced by the time they graduate. Its students also benefit from state-of-the-art equipment and facilities â€“ including on its London and Scarborough campuses â€“ in all academic disciplines, from health, business and performing arts to industrial design, engineering and computing.\n\nIn recent years Coventryâ€™s student satisfaction levels and teaching quality have been rated amongst the best in the UK, which in turn has led to impressive rises in every major university league table. The combination of these successes and its innovative approach to developments in the sector â€“ including the Institute for Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering and a new campus in Scarborough â€“ earned Coventry the title â€˜University of the Yearâ€™ in the THE Awards 2015, and saw it secure a gold rating in the UK governmentâ€™s Teaching Excellence Framework (REF) in 2017.\n\nAs of 2018 the institution is the countryâ€™s top modern university in both the Guardian University Guide â€“ in which it ranks 13th overall â€“ and the Complete University Guide, as well as being named â€˜Modern University of the Yearâ€™ in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide for three years running from 2014 to 2016. Coventry also places in the top 200 in the THE Young University Rankings 2017.",

        "description": "MMA Capital Management, LLC, formerly known as MuniMae, is a real estate asset management company that invests in and manages debt and equity investments collateralized primarily by multifamily housing.  Formerly operating as a master limited partnership for tax purposes, in July 2013 we converted to a taxable corporation.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S the company focuses on three types of real estate investment. Primarily, we own and manage tax-exempt bonds, a substantial majority of which are backed by affordable multifamily rental properties. In addition, we own direct investments in real estate that include multifamily housing, undeveloped land and other development opportunities.  Finally, we manage tax credit equity funds for third party investors which invest in similar affordable multifamily rental properties.\r\n\r\nOutside of the US, MMA Capital Managementâ€™s strategy is to raise, invest in and manage private real estate funds which invest in affordable for-sale and rental housing in South Africa. Substantially all of the Companyâ€™s international operations take place through International Housing Solutions (â€œIHSâ€). MMA Capital Management owns a substantial majority, approximately 96%, of IHS. To learn about IHS go to www.ihsinvestments.co.za.\r\n\r\nMMA Capital Management common shares are currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol MMAC. For additional information about the NASDAQ Capital Market please visit: www.nasdaq.com.\r\n\r\nOur core values are Integrity, Innovation and Service. These values are the foundation on which we have built our business.\r\n\r\nRelated Companies:\r\nMMA Financial\r\nMMA Realty Capital",

        "description": "\"75 years of Tradition of excellence in Engineering & Technology Education, Research and Innovations\" \r\n\r\nDelhi College of Engineering, (initially established with the name â€“ Delhi Polytechnic) came into existence in the year 1941 to cater the needs of Indian industries for trained technical manpower with practical experience and sound theoretical knowledge. The institution was set up at historic Kashmere Gate campus as a follow up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. It comprised of a multi disciplinary and multi level institution offering wide ranging programmes in engineering, technology, arts and sculpture, architecture, pharmacy and commerce. The national diploma awarded by the institution was recognized as equivalent to degree level for the purposes of employment. \r\n\r\nIn 1952 the college was affiliated with University of Delhi and started formal Degree level Programmes.

        "description": "YCore is a social impact fellowship for young professionals mobilizing the next generation of champions for just, inclusive communities. We believe that education and action are crucial to activate more time, money and resources, so weâ€™ve designed programming to help young professionals launch their social impact journeys. In our four-month, after-work program, young professionals build capacity for local nonprofits while also gaining the knowledge and experience to become better volunteers, donors and community advocates. YCore was founded in 2014 by a group of Stanford alumni who believed in the power of young professionals to add value to the social sectorâ€“now, not later. In just four years, we've mobilized 200 young professionals who have donated 10,000 hours and $2M in project value to more than 30 Bay Area nonprofits like Hack the Hood, Kiva, Compass Family Services, Ella Baker Center and more.",

        "description": "MMA Capital Management, LLC, formerly known as MuniMae, is a real estate asset management company that invests in and manages debt and equity investments collateralized primarily by multifamily housing.  Formerly operating as a master limited partnership for tax purposes, in July 2013 we converted to a taxable corporation.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S the company focuses on three types of real estate investment. Primarily, we own and manage tax-exempt bonds, a substantial majority of which are backed by affordable multifamily rental properties. In addition, we own direct investments in real estate that include multifamily housing, undeveloped land and other development opportunities.  Finally, we manage tax credit equity funds for third party investors which invest in similar affordable multifamily rental properties.\r\n\r\nOutside of the US, MMA Capital Managementâ€™s strategy is to raise, invest in and manage private real estate funds which invest in affordable for-sale and rental housing in South Africa. Substantially all of the Companyâ€™s international operations take place through International Housing Solutions (â€œIHSâ€). MMA Capital Management owns a substantial majority, approximately 96%, of IHS. To learn about IHS go to www.ihsinvestments.co.za.\r\n\r\nMMA Capital Management common shares are currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol MMAC.

        "description": "\"75 years of Tradition of excellence in Engineering & Technology Education, Research and Innovations\" \r\n\r\nDelhi College of Engineering, (initially established with the name â€“ Delhi Polytechnic) came into existence in the year 1941 to cater the needs of Indian industries for trained technical manpower with practical experience and sound theoretical knowledge. The institution was set up at historic Kashmere Gate campus as a follow up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. It comprised of a multi disciplinary and multi level institution offering wide ranging programmes in engineering, technology, arts and sculpture, architecture, pharmacy and commerce. The national diploma awarded by the institution was recognized as equivalent to degree level for the purposes of employment. \r\n\r\nIn 1952 the college was affiliated with University of Delhi and started formal Degree level Programmes. The department of Architecture later became the School of Planning and Architecture, now a Deemed University and Institution of National importance. The department of Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology were shifted out en-block to mark beginning of the IIT Delhi at its new campus at Hauz Khas. The department of commerce was later abolished and the faculty of management studies of the University of Delhi was established by Prof. A Das Gupta, of DCE. Delhi College of Engineering is thus the mother institution of a number of national projects including IITD, SPA, College of Arts and even the famous FMS.\r\n\r\nTill 1962, the college was under the direct control of Ministry of Education, Government of India. In 1963, the administration of the college was handed over to Delhi Administration. Delhi College of Engineering was under the administrative control of Department of Technical Education & Training, Govt. of NCT of Delhi. For academic purposes, the college was affiliated to University of Delhi since 1952. From July 20...",

In our four-month, after-work program, young professionals build capacity for local nonprofits while also gaining the knowledge and experience to become better volunteers, donors and community advocates. YCore was founded in 2014 by a group of Stanford alumni who believed in the power of young professionals to add value to the social sectorâ€“now, not later. In just four years, we've mobilized 200 young professionals who have donated 10,000 hours and $2M in project value to more than 30 Bay Area nonprofits like Hack the Hood, Kiva, Compass Family Services, Ella Baker Center and more.",

From the relatively narrow scope of Armament Studies alone in the Fifties, the role of the Institute was considerably enlarged by the Defence R&D Council in 1964 and further in 1981.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of accreditation by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), Pune University recognised eight courses for the award of ME degree in 1980. In the year 2000, the Institute acquired the status of a Deemed University. IAT has been renamed as DIAT w.e.f. 1st April 2006.",

HPAIR organizes Harvard University's largest annual student conferences in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\nSince 1991, we have continuously gathered a growing pool of international students from top universities, renowned academics, business professionals, and political leaders to engage in our rigorous conference events. Our programs intend to achieve three goals: provide a dynamic forum of exchange on international issues vital to Asia; foster long-term relationships among young leaders from around the globe; and connect talented delegates with some of today's leaders in academia, business and government.\n\nToday, HPAIR offers two annual conferences: the Harvard Conference in February and the Asia Conference in August. Through plenary sessions, panels, keynotes, workshops, and case studies, the conferences provide valuable opportunities for discussion about challenges and trends in the international landscape.

We are building new holistic, integrated and long term developmental methodologies that enable us to work with children in an age-transitional way, all the way from young childhood into adulthood, from age 10 to 28.\n\nAs of today Make a Difference works with approximately 3500 children in partnership with 60 shelters across 23 cities in India, through a highly efficient and unique operating model that is almost entirely volunteer driven with an overall workforce size of 4000 in flat, distributed structure that runs on virtual infrastructure. We operate at less than 1/10th the cost of an equivalent sized non-profit, with no loss in continuity, retention or quality, and are pioneers in both culture and organisational design that is specialized for impact. \n\nMake A Difference consistently ranks in the Top 10 Best NGOs to Work For in India, and most recently ranked in India's Top 10 Great Mid-size Workplaces across all sectors in the Great Place To Work Institute's 2018 Survey.",

We have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and the spirit and heart of a small one.\n\nTogether, Amazonians research and develop new technologies from Amazon Web Services to Alexa on behalf of our customers: shoppers, sellers, content creators, and developers around the world.\n\nOur mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.\n\nYou'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always \"Day 1.\"​ What do we mean?

From offering search in a single language we now offer dozens of products and services—including various forms of advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasks—in scores of languages. And starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, we now have thousands of employees and offices around the world. A lot has changed since the first Google search engine appeared. But some things haven’t changed: our dedication to our users and our belief in the possibilities of the Internet itself.",

We are a bunch of motivated and driven individuals that attract a great deal of media due to our project endeavors and application oriented workshops.\n\nWe work on developing a prototype of the Martian rover which we use to compete in different international competitions including URC (University Rover Challenge), ERC (European Rover Challenge) and UKURC (UK University Rover Challenge). These competitions provide a platform for student-run teams from all over the globe to showcase their respective rovers.\n\nIn our previous two (i.e. in 2015 and 2016) participations in ERC we were able to complete all the tasks successfully and secured 13th and 12th rank respectively among teams from top universities such as McGill, Yale, IIT-Bombay and many others. We were also ranked 1st in Asia in both editions.\n\nWorking in the Rover team brings with it, a chance to work with students from various disciplines of engineering, therefore enhancing our knowledge. Viewing a problem from different perspectives helps us explore different possibilities. It provides us the opportunity to work with the team and follow a timeline based approach. Henceforth helps us understand the work culture in industries and problem-solving in the real world. This according to us is a critical component that goes behind creating future engineers.\n\nThe Rover Challenge happens to be the perfect match, challenging enough to keep us on our toes all the time. They provide an application-based platform where we can apply our theoretical knowledge, showcase our talent and have some fun.",

        "description": "About UrbanClap\nUrbanClap is India's largest home services marketplace. The platform helps customers book reliable home services – from beauty services to fitness training, appliance repair to plumbing etc. Since its inception in 2014, UrbanClap has built a network of 25,000+ trained service professionals, and served millions of customers across major metropolitan cities of India and Dubai.\n\nCompany's vision\nUrbanClap's vision is to empower 1 million+ service professionals to become micro service entrepreneurs. Prior to joining UrbanClap, most of these professionals, be it plumbers, beauticians, carpenters etc., would typically earn INR 10-15k per month, working for a local shop, aggregator or as a freelancer. The UrbanClap platform enables these professionals to become micro-entrepreneurs by helping them in 5 key areas –\n\nCustomer Access & Brand\n●    Working as an managed franchisee of UrbanClap\nFinancing & Insurance\n●    Opening bank accounts, access to loans for upfront kits, 2-wheelers, home etc. \n●    Life and Accidental Insurance Programs\nTech-Led Standardization\n●    Standardizing the service - creating SKUs, fixed and transparent pricing, clear service deliverables, defined SOPs, delivery tracking, payment systems, reviews etc., to help remove friction from the service experience\nTraining & Certification\n●    Soft and Core Skills Training imparted in our training centers and via the app\nProduct Procurement\n●    Purchasing consumables (Spares, cosmetics, paints etc.) needed for service delivery in bulk\n \nThis helps service professionals become more organized, and multiplies their earnings. E.g. - Our beauticians typically earn INR 40 to 50k per month with no upper ceiling (Many earn > INR 100k per month), while in the local salons, they would earn between INR 8 to 15k per month\n\nMore on the company's vision and culture can be explored through the videos hosted here - https://careers.urbanclap.com/",

Initially, the club visited karunalaya, an orphanage in Vellore. As of today they are visiting sacred hearts every weekend and are working at improving the life standards of the children. They teach the children on various aspects and also have fun time with them.\n\n Project SOCH, works with an ideology which believes in empowering today’s youth through the medium they are most comfortable with i.e. social media. The videography of various concurrent topics and the voice of youth sessions conducted by this project aims at giving a platform for the youth of today to voice out their opinions about the societal stigmas affecting the world.\n\n Project GLOBAL LEADERSHIP LABS, commonly known as GLL, works with an agenda of making leaders out of the people as leaders are the need of today’s society. This project conducts a semester long leadership programme which aims at giving a chance for the leaders within to arise from their previous selves.\n\nUPHAAR was yet another initiative undertaken by FEPSI which was a thanksgiving to all the Skilled and unskilled labour working in VIT to make our stay a happier one. Our motive in doing this was to inculcate the art of respecting the person for what he is and to respect the concept of dignity of labour.\n\nNot all good work gets acknowledged by the society, the ones truly helping out often stay inconspicuous and the deed often remains hidden. With the concept of “not working for recognition but for a good cause” in mind, FEPSI has undertaken MANNAT; a social helpline drive where the clothes collected from the students of VIT are distributed to the homeless people of Vellore along with medicines if required by them. The best part of this social drive is that it takes place with absolute zero publicity and thus fits into the term – a silent prayer.",

        "description": "Since its inception in 1880, Exide remains the first and foremost battery brand in India. Exide's journey dates back to as far as the 1880s when the automobile battery was at its infancy and evolving to maturity step by step. While the lead acid battery had been discovered in 1860, storage batteries began to be produced by Mather & Platt in the 1880s. \r\nEvolving into Excellence:\r\nDuring World War I, Chloride engineers developed a lightweight, non-spillage battery to operate thousands of airplane radio sets and numerous radio stations.\r\nIn 1934, an Exide deep-cycle battery was the sole source of electrical power at a military base in Antarctica.\r\nExide batteries also provided power for Piccard's balloon flight.\r\nThe Company was incorporated as Associated Battery Makers (Eastern) Ltd., on 31st January, 1947 under the Companies Act, 1913 The name of the Company was changed to Chloride India Ltd on 2nd August, 1972. The name of the Company was further changed to Exide Industries Ltd. on 25th August, 1995.\r\nThe Company manufactures the widest range of storage batteries in the world from 2.5 Ah to 20,400 Ah capacity, covering the broadest spectrum of applications. The Company has also recently forayed into manufacture and sale of Home UPS/Inverters. The Company has seven battery manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country – three in Maharashtra, two in West Bengal, one in Tamil Nadu and one in Haryana also two Home UPS/Inverter manufacturing facilities in Uttarakhand. The Company’s predecessor carried on their operations as import house from 1916 under the name Chloride Electrical Storage Company. Thereafter, the Company started manufacturing storage batteries in the country and have grown to become one of the largest manufacturer and exporter of batteries in the sub-continent today. Exide separated from its UK-based parent, Chloride Group Plc., in 1989, after the latter divested its ownership in favour of a group of Indian shareholders.",

        "description": "FEPSI: Forum for Empowering People through Social Innovation and entertainment, VIT is an NGO well known for its activities in and around Vellore and is known to all as FEPSI-VIT. It is a very famous NGO and boasts of extreme working ability which attributes to its popularity which it has earned in a very short span of time. With a mere 6 years since its inception, FEPSI has earned a lot of respect for the work it does. The sincerity and the dedication of its members towards the theme of the club has been its impetus all along.\n\nWORK WE DO: FEPSI, in the basic level, has 3 projects currently working.\n\nPROJECT ULLAS, is the face of FEPSI. The sole aim of this project is empowerment beginning at the school level. As a part of this project, members of the club visit a school or orphanage and spend quality time with the children. Initially, the club visited karunalaya, an orphanage in Vellore. As of today they are visiting sacred hearts every weekend and are working at improving the life standards of the children. They teach the children on various aspects and also have fun time with them.\n\n Project SOCH, works with an ideology which believes in empowering today’s youth through the medium they are most comfortable with i.e. social media. The videography of various concurrent topics and the voice of youth sessions conducted by this project aims at giving a platform for the youth of today to voice out their opinions about the societal stigmas affecting the world.\n\n Project GLOBAL LEADERSHIP LABS, commonly known as GLL, works with an agenda of making leaders out of the people as leaders are the need of today’s society. This project conducts a semester long leadership programme which aims at giving a chance for the leaders within to arise from their previous selves.\n\nUPHAAR was yet another initiative undertaken by FEPSI which was a thanksgiving to all the Skilled and unskilled labour working in VIT to make our stay a happier one. Our motive in doing this was to inculcate the art of respecting the person for what he is and to respect the concept of dignity of labour.\n\nNot all good work gets acknowledged by the society, the ones truly helping out often stay inconspicuous and the deed often remains hidden. With the concept of “not working for recognition but for a good cause” in mind, FEPSI has undertaken MANNAT; a social helpline drive where the clothes collected from the students of VIT are distributed to the homeless people of Vellore along with medicines if required by them. The best part of this social drive is that it takes place with absolute zero publicity and thus fits into the term – a silent prayer.",

The nonprofit organization now has nearly 250,000 members in more than 12,500 clubs in 106 countries, offering a proven – and enjoyable! – way to practice and hone communication and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nMost Toastmasters meetings are comprised of approximately 20 people who meet weekly for an hour or two. Participants practice and learn skills by filling a meeting role, ranging from giving a prepared speech or an impromptu one to serving as timer, evaluator or grammarian.\r\n\r\nThere is no instructor; instead, each speech and meeting is critiqued by a member in a positive manner, focusing on what was done right and what could be improved.\r\n\r\nGood communicators tend to be good leaders. Some well-known Toastmasters alumni include:\r\n\r\n    * Peter Coors of Coors Brewing Company\r\n    * Debbi Fields, founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies\r\n    * Tom Peters, management expert and author\r\n    * Linda Lingle, Governor of Hawaii",

A passenger books an auto over call, SMS, Whatsapp, or mobile application. A police-verified and professionally-trained auto driver will reach their doorstep at the stipulated time, driving a well-maintained autorickshaw. Women drivers, AutoRanis, too work with us. The passenger saves up to Rs 100 per trip as AutoRaja provides a cheaper alternative to expensive roadside autos and call taxis. The driver earns Rs 10,000 extra every month.\r\n\r\nAutoRaja addresses the painpoints of commuters by offering immediate booking, scheduled booking, and regular trip booking – for school and office-goers – facilities. In addition, a fleet of AutoRajas and AutoRanis – all police-verified and trained professionally by us – along with full-time on-journey support and tracking of vehicles make commuting safe. By also addressing socio-economic challenges faced by auto drivers, AutoRaja innovates in the driver-engagement domain – and thus, ensuring low-cost scalability and better hook over drivers.\r\n\r\nAutoRaja's Fleet Size: 2000 autos",

With over 10,000 exclusive hotels in its chain, OYO is one of a kind and has pioneered the world’s first full stack technology led hospitality model. Its network includes major metros, regional business hubs, top leisure destinations as well as pilgrimage towns. \n \nOYO was founded by Ritesh Agarwal, the first resident Asian to be accepted to the Thiel Fellowship (started by Paypal founder Peter Thiel). He was featured in Forbes 30 under 30 in Consumer Tech (2016) for creating a global disruptor. OYO was recently chosen as India’s Most Promising Hotel Network (HolidayIQ Better Holiday Awards 2017) and has received several accolades including Express IT Startup of the Year Award (2015), NDTV Dream Chaser of the Year (2016) and IAMAI Digital Startup of the Year (2016). It was recognized by Business Today as among the Coolest Start-Ups in India (2016) and ranked by LinkedIn as one of the top employee attractors in India two years in a row (2016, 2017). OYO is backed by leading global investors, including the SoftBank Group, Lightspeed India, Sequoia Capital and Greenoaks Capital.\n\nOYO revolutionalized the fragmented and legacy-driven budget hospitality space in India by enabling standardization of services, amenities and in-room experience. Through the use of its proprietary apps for inventory-management, room-service, revenue-management and customer-relationship management, OYO has delivered predictable, affordable and available budget-room accommodation to millions of travellers in India.\n\nIn January 2017, OYO launched Townhouse - a managed hotel-brand designed to function as a social hotspot to cater to city dwellers and a new generation of guests. \nOYO Townhouse - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVMQgODN9KI\n\nFor more information log on to www.oyorooms.com \nDownload our app from oyoroo.ms/app\nCheck out our blog at oyorooms.com/blog",

It is estimated that about 65% of the children in the world receive at least one vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute. Vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute are accredited by the World Health Organization, Geneva and are being used in around 170 countries across the globe in their national immunization programs, saving millions of lives throughout the world.\n\nSerum Institute of India is ranked as India's No. 1 biotechnology company, manufacturing highly specialized life saving biologicals like vaccines using cutting edge genetic and cell based technologies, antisera and other medical specialties.\n\nSerum Institute of India was founded in 1966 by Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla with the aim of manufacturing life-saving immuno-biologicals, which were in shortage in the country and imported at high prices. Thereafter, several life-saving biologicals were manufactured at prices affordable to the common man and in abundance, with the result that the country was made self-sufficient for Tetanus Anti-toxin and Anti-snake Venom serum, followed by DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) group of Vaccines and then later on MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) group of vaccines.\n\nThe Philanthropic philosophy of the company still not only exists but has been proliferated to bring down the prices of newer vaccines such as Hepatitis-B vaccine, Combination vaccine etc., so that not only Indian's, but the entire under-privileged children of the world are protected from birth onwards.",

It creates disruptive technologies that happen at the edges, pioneering such areas as wearable computing, tangible interfaces, and affective computing. Today, faculty members, research staff, and students at the Lab work in more than 25 research groups on more than 350 projects that range from digital approaches for treating neurological disorders, to a stackable, electric car for sustainable cities, to advanced imaging technologies that can “see around a corner.” The Lab is committed to looking beyond the obvious to ask the questions not yet asked–questions whose answers could radically improve the way people live, learn, express themselves, work, and play.",

Driven by a vision to enhance global healthcare through innovative and affordable biopharmaceuticals, we have enabled access to advanced therapies for diseases that are chronic, where medical needs are largely unmet and treatment costs are high. \n\nThe early anticipation of the increasing dominance of biologics in global development pipelines helped us to be ahead of the curve in crafting a differentiated product portfolio based on fermentation and recombinant technologies, which straddles fermentation-derived small molecules and biologics, both novel as well as biosimilars.\n\nThe significant brand equity that we have built worldwide for our small molecule APIs across statins, immunosuppresants and other specialty products has made us a leading global supplier of these products.\n\nWe have also built one of the largest and most diverse biosimilar pipelines, spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that address critical chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disorders.\n\nRanked among the Top 3 biosimilar players globally for rh-insulin and insulin glargine in volume terms, we are the first Indian company to launch a biosimilar in Japan with Insulin Glargine, which also has been approved for sale in EU and Australia. Our insulin products have made a difference to the lives of millions of people with diabetes across the globe. We now aim to provide our insulin products to ‘one in five’ people with diabetes in need of insulin-based therapy anywhere in the world within the next 10 years.\n\nWe are also making a huge impact in the area of cancer care. Our biosimilar Trastuzumab, which was the first to be approved anywhere in the world and launched in India in 2014, has helped treat several thousand HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. We are also the first company from India to get its biosimilar approved by the USFDA; Ogivri™, co-developed by Biocon and Mylan, is the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved in the US. In addition to Trastuzumab, several of our biosimilar assets are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets.\n\nWe are also developing a pipeline of patented biologics to address global unmet medical needs. We have successfully launched a couple of novel biologics in India: Nimotuzumab for the treatment of head and neck cancer and Itolizumab to tackle psoriasis. Besides these, we have a basket of novel assets are under various stages of clinical development, including a high potential oral insulin.\n\nThrough our subsidiary, Syngene, we offer a suite of integrated, end-to-end discovery and development services for novel molecular entities (NMEs) to the global life sciences sector.\n\nRanked by the prestigious Science magazine among the Top 10 Best employers in the biotech industry, Biocon is passionately pursuing a mission to rationalize healthcare spends, enhance access to life-saving therapies and make a significant impact to global healthcare through ‘blockbuster’ drugs with the potential to benefit a billion patients.",

TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.\r\n\r\nTED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. On TED.com, we're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other, both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.\r\n\r\nIn fact, everything we do — from our TED Talks videos to the projects sparked by the TED Prize, from the global TEDx community to the TED-Ed lesson series — is driven by this goal: How can we best spread great ideas?",

To stay in the competition and keep the customers growing companies and brands have to innovate continuously in terms of their products, services, customer relations, branding, marketing etc.\nThe internal sources for innovation for a company are proven to be insufficient in this regard.

We are the first to discover water in moon. Now latest project Chandrayyan 2 in which rover will land to the moon and  the  most challenging Chandrayyan 3 for Human Space Programme in which man will land to the moon. As we all know we are world leader in Rocket technology and IT industry, still we are far behind in defense area. Next war will be space war and we will be using Satellites for guiding missiles and anti missiles. We are going to launch RADAR Imaging Satellite which can be used in night also. We have a few spy satellites and also going to launch most advanced spy satellites. If we use  both the above technology, we can do miracle. Missiles need rocket technology and  processor needs software technology. Satellite based GPS system can be used for space war. Our nation has all technical resources and can lead the world.  We need the strong leader who can think of this. Work for Nation - A real enjoyment.  Don't fight among our self instead make the nation strong so that no one can dare in the world to fight us.

We are building new holistic, integrated and long term developmental methodologies that enable us to work with children in an age-transitional way, all the way from young childhood into adulthood, from age 10 to 28.\n\nAs of today Make a Difference works with approximately 3500 children in partnership with 60 shelters across 23 cities in India, through a highly efficient and unique operating model that is almost entirely volunteer driven with an overall workforce size of 4000 in flat, distributed structure that runs on virtual infrastructure. We operate at less than 1/10th the cost of an equivalent sized non-profit, with no loss in continuity, retention or quality, and are pioneers in both culture and organisational design that is specialized for impact. \n\nMake A Difference consistently ranks in the Top 10 Best NGOs to Work For in India, and most recently ranked in India's Top 10 Great Mid-size Workplaces across all sectors in the Great Place To Work Institute's 2018 Survey.",

Get this wrong and an organization could attract the attention of government authorities, tarnish their brand and generate very little leads.  \n\nUniqLeads Research provides targeted contact and account based research for niche B2B markets - mostly commercial b2b conference companies, recruiters and IT vendors. What we do can be summarised into three main tasks; \n\n1. We clean up existing databases/email lists\n2. We enhance the value of existing databases/email lists \n3. We build new databases/email lists \n\nWe believe quality over quantity is important so all our work is done by real people and not a computer algorithm. \n\nAll our clients have unique target markets so we don't have or nor can we sell databases of existing Contacts or Accounts. \n\nWe keep our process as simple as possible to ensure client satisfaction. \n1. Receive brief from client \n2. We map out the value chain of the client's target market and summarize the brief\n3. Client confirms the accuracy of the value chain and brief, and then approves the project \n4. We start our research and provide a list of contacts and accounts researched to the client on a daily basis for immediate use or feedback\n5. When the project is completed, we send the final list to the client and delete our record so the client has the only copy\n\nOur highly trained staff in Kochi India and the quality of the marketing lists we research is our value proposition. \n\nContact us for a free trial and see this for yourself - there's no commitment but we're confident you'll be pleased with the result.",

This was highlighted by Otago’s success under the New Zealand Government’s 2012 Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF) quality evaluation, which confirmed Otago's position as the leading research institution in New Zealand. \n\nOtago is at the forefront of modern scholarship and has a long-established tradition of innovation. It is for this reason Otago is able to attract first-rate academics, and our graduates are renowned for their independence and audacity of spirit.",

The Government signed a concession agreement with BIAL in July 2004 paving the way for development of Bangalore’s Greenfield airport. Establishing a legal framework played a critical role in providing a safe and encouraging environment for private promoters.
