I am one of those few who love what they do. \n\nIn the 20+ years of my professional life, I wore many hats; of a Facilitator, Consultant, Advisor, Coach, Strategist, CEO and Entrepreneur. I’ve navigated numerous challenges and gained tremendous learning, unique multi-discipline understanding and ability, which is leveraged by my clients and me alike. \n\nAs an OD and Change Management Consultant/Practitioner, I extend my understanding of behavioral science and frameworks of Change and OD to co-create uniquely organic solutions for the clients. I approach the interventions with an inquisitive inquirer’s mindset and an Action Researcher’s approach. \n\nAs an Executive Coach for transformation and life skills, I work with Entrepreneurs & Leaders who are on a mission to create something remarkable through their organization or transforming their organization to something more remarkable than it already is. I make myself available to my coaching clients as a firm, non-judgmental, turnaround catalyst & support system empowering them to create wonders & take on the challenges head on. My clients often express that they find my knack of asking such questions which broadens their perspectives, very empowering and supportive. While, I find this as \"living my life’s purpose\"​ of empowering others; it is abundantly fulfilling for me. \n\nI head a consulting company, Auralis Consulting offering consulting in Organization Development, Change & Transformation, Coaching and Mentoring, tailored L&D and Training solutions. \n\nWhen I’m not on one of the left brained adventures, I am busy recharging my right brain.

                "description": "Multi-Resolution Tracking in Space and Time \n \nThis project proposes efficient and robust methods for tracking a moving object at multiple spatial and  temporal resolution levels. The efficiency comes from optimizing the amounts of spatial and temporal data processed. The robustness results from multi-level coarse-to-fine state-space searching. Tracking across resolution levels incurs an accuracy-versus-speed trade-off with higher resolutions maintaining a higher accuracy at the cost of greater processing cost and time and lower resolutions reducing both the processing time and accuracy. We propose a novel spatial multi-scale tracker that tracks at the optimal accuracy-versus-speed operating point. Next, we relax this requirement to propose a multi-resolution tracker that operates at a minimum acceptable performance level. Finally, we extend these ideas to a multi-resolution spatio-temporal tracker\n\nIndustrial Projects:\n\nName of assignment or project: \n1.
