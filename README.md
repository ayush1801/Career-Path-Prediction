### Abstract
Career counselling has become an important aspect due to the emergence of various professions. A country like India, facing favourable demographic dividend could gain a lot if career counselling is effectively and efficiently implemented. Realizing this scenario and understanding the non-trivial task of career counselling, we have put the hat of a career counsellor on machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we apply machine learning algorithms such as k-means clustering, Markov chain to model the career path of an individual through the collection of profiles and features extraction from descriptive information available in LinkedIn. We solve the problem that given a personâ€™s current position and his/her goal, what is the best career path recommended for him/her. The model is applied to an Indian setting separately for privately funded technical institutions and government funded technical institutions. Further, differences and similarities are discussed between the outcomes of the models. As a conclusion, analysis of results and discussion of possible improvements in the model are presented.
